"," Tuesday, World Bank released the 2012 World Development Report (WDR) on Gender Equality and Development. With few specific mentions of Australia, women in the country appear to be doing better than many other countries discussed. This includes areas like education, health, life expectancy, and willingness to work part time.
 In 1979, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Early on, the report credits the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, inspired by CEDAW, with dealing with inequality issues such as discrimination based on sex, marital status, and pregnancy or potential pregnancy.
 The WDR 2012 team estimates based on World Values Surveys found little change in attitudes for people who agree that university education is more important for boys than girls, with around 8% of Australians saying yes between 1994 and 1999, and 5% saying yes between 2005 and 2007. About 25% of Australians said men should have more rights to jobs than women between 1994 and 1999.  This dropped to 15% between 2005 and 2007.
 The report says married Australian women working part-time are amongst a few nationalities who prefer their current working hours, and would not desire to change to a full time position.  The report contrasts this to Honduras where married women working part-time would like to move to full-time but are unable to do so because of the lack of available employment.
 The report suggests economic well being is not a good predictor of Australian female fertility. The top 20% of female earners have an average of about 1.5 children compared to the bottom 20% who have an average of 2 children.
 While girls score slightly lower than boys on the Programme for International Student Assessment mathematics test at around 510 to 520 on the mean score, girls outperformed boys in literacy approximately 530 to 500. The report attributes overall patterns of girls outperforming boys at literacy and boys outperforming girls at maths to gender expectations reinforced in textbooks.  It sites current examples of this in Australia and Hong Kong. On the maths test, Australian girls slightly outperformed girls from Estonia, Belgium and Germany, while girls from New Zealand, Macau, the Netherlands, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Finland, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore outperformed their Australian counterparts. On the literacy test, Australian girls slightly outperformed their Norwegian and Polish counterparts.  The only countries sampled outperforming Australian girls at literacy were Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Singapore, Hong Kong, Finland and South Korea.  
 From 1991 to 2009, the gross enrolment ratio for Australian females in primary and secondary school declined by 1% and 2% respectively.  For tertiary education, there was a 52% increase for females.  The average life expectancy of Australian women went from 80 in 1990 to 84 in 2009. During the same period, male life expectancy grew from 74 years to 79 years. Australia's Parliament had 6% women in 1990 and grew to 25% women in 2010.

"," Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott allowed for potential Australian support in any military action the United States may take in resolving the current conflict in Iraq, during and after a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday.
 The President had said all options were on the table for dealing with the Al-Qaeda splinter group of Sunni militants who have violently overrun many areas of the war torn county.
 A major Al-Qaeda foodhold in Iraq ""would be a humanitarian disaster for the people of Iraq, quite apart from being a very serious problem for the region and the wider world"" said Abbot to ABC Radio, emphasising the consequences this conflict could have on the already unstable region.
 Whilst the United States has not requested Australian aid, Abbott expressed concern the situation could become a problem for Australia and the rest of the world.  In remarks to Sky News, he said, ""I want to do what we reasonably can to protect Australian citizens, Australian interests and Australian values, and there is a very strong community of interests and values between the United States and Australia and our other principal allies"".
 Abbott advised this conflict in Iraq would allow terrorist organisations to gain a stronger position globally, as the war in Syria allowed terrorist groups to hoard large amounts of weapons and money.
 Abbott's position on this issue in Iraq has been met with criticism from different members of parliament. Opposition leader Bill Shorten warned ""Australia always needs to weigh up the use of our highly professional and dedicated soldiers as to whether or not it is in the Australian National interest"". Greens leader Christine Milne said Australia should focus efforts on diplomatic solutions through nonviolent action and the United Nations to bring about long-term stability and reconciliation in Iraq.
 However Peter Jennings, head of think tank the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, supported Australia's offer of support, though acknowledging Australia could do little as a main player in this conflict. Jennings also advised that providing intelligence via surveillance may be a way for Australia to help in a supporting role.
 According to recent information from the Australian federal government's service Smartraveller, at least 90 Australians were on holiday in Iraq despite a no-travel warning for that country.

"," An anti-budget protest descended on Brisbane, Australia today in response to this past Tuesday's federal budget. Among the speakers at the pre-march rally were Australian Labor Party (ALP) senator Claire Moore and former Australian Democrats senator — and current Queensland Greens convenor — Andrew Bartlett.
 Mr. Bartlett conveyed to the crowd that the Australian Greens would do everything in their power to block the budget legislation in parliament. Senator Moore was not heard stating similar of the ALP but spoke passionately against the budget.

"," The Prime Minister of Australia, Julia Gillard, has today announced a new bill into Parliament to assist in the Queensland floods recovery. The proposed levy will be a once-off tax, given only to those with an annual income of above A$50,000. 
 Exemptions to the flood relief fund will be given to those who are income earners of less than $50,000 a year or those who were affected by the flood crisis. Anyone earning between the ranges of $50,000 to $100,000 will contribute 0.5 percent of their income whilst anyone earning over $100,000 annually will pay 1 percent.
 During her announcement, Gillard stated: ""Under this levy, someone who has an income of $60,000 will pay just under $1 extra per week. A person earning $100,000 per year will pay just under an extra $5 per week.""
 The levy is set to contribute to the relief effort to assist in the five-billion-dollar reconstruction of Queensland infrastructure. The Government will obtain three billion dollars through the scratching of certain schemes and the postponement of others. The levy will then contribute the other two billion.
 The bill has not come without criticism. The leader of the opposing Liberal Party, Tony Abbott, has claimed that there is ""fat"" in the budget. He said there should be no requirement for Australians to contribute towards a levy, but rather the government should cut back on its own spending.
 Gillard responded to Abbott's claims by saying that the Liberal's proposed paid maternity leave scheme would have required Australian people to pay a levy, and that it is unjustifiable that they then wouldn’t allow for the rebuilding of Queensland.
 Independent Bob Katter has said that until a designated fund for natural disaster relief is established by the Government, he will not approve of any relief levies introduced into parliament. Tony Windsor, a fellow independent, agreed. With Labor currently in a minority government, the passing of the bill is in jeopardy without the support of the independents (which of whom, except for Bob Katter, formed government with Labor).
 There is currently no certainty that the bill will be introduced yet. It must first be approved in the Lower House and then in the Senate.

"," Australian minister for foreign affairs, Alexander Downer (Mayo, Liberal), told the Australian House of Representatives on Tuesday that Australia would provide assistance to East Timor if the East Timorese government or United Nations requested it.
 Northern Territory member, David Tollner (Solomon,Country Liberal), who has long had an interest in East Timorese affairs, asked Mr Downer to update the parliament on ""recent developments in East Timor"".
 Riots in East Timor's capital Dilli killed five people on April 28 following a march supporting 600 East Timorese soldiers who were dismissed for deserting following complaints of discrimination between those from the east and west of East Timor. The Australian government issued a travel advisory for East Timor on May 4, 2006 advising Australians to avoid the country.
 Mr Downer today told parliament that there was no indication of violence against foreigners despite the warning still being in place. He continued by saying that the government was ""deeply concerned"" and would continue to monitor the situation closely. ""We have, in a number of ways, strongly urged the leaders of East Timor to resolve quickly and peacefully the differences that there are and, of course, to do so with full regard for the democratic institutions of the country, its constitution, the rule of law and international norms of human rights."" said Mr Downer.
 Parliament also heard that Australia had agreed with members of the United Nations Security Council to conduct a new operation in East Timor. ""Australia does stand ready to offer assistance if requested by either the East Timor government directly or the United Nations."" Mr Downer told parliament.

"," Australian Prime Minister John Howard announced on Tuesday that Old Parliament House in Canberra has been heritage listed. It is the 31st entry on the National Heritage List.
 The listing acknowledges the role the building has in shaping Australia's culture and protects it from being modified in any way which could affect its historic value.
 Old Parliament House served as the home of Australia's parliament from 1927 until 1988, when it was relocated to the present parliament house. From 1901-1927, parliament met in Melbourne in the Victorian Parliament House (the state parliament was relocated for 26 years). Before being known as Old Parliament House, the building was known as Provisional Parliament House - as it was intended to be used for 50 years before a permanent building could be built.
 In the 61 years the building was used as the seat of parliament, the government changed only seven times, and several new political parties were formed (the Liberals, Anti-Communist Labor Party, and the Australian Democrats).
 Mr Howard said the building played an important part in Australia's political history. ""Old Parliament House will always be an important part of our political history with its rich collection of original furniture, art and memorabilia helping to illustrate the story of Australia's political customs and functions,"" he said.
 According to Mr Howard, the National Heritage List lists sites which have helped shape the country. ""The National Heritage List contains places that have played an important role in the development of our nation, such as Captain Cook’s landing place in New South Wales, Port Arthur in Tasmania and the Australian War Memorial in Canberra,"" said the Prime Minister.
 The building currently houses Australia's National Portrait Gallery, and serves as a venue for receptions and exhbitions.

"," Australia's parliament will be hung after this year's federal election. With 73% of the nation wide vote counted, the governing Australian Labor Party has been confirmed to have 50.7% of the two party preferred votes, and predicted to win 73 seats in the House of Representatives, 3 short of majority.
 The coalition of the Liberal and National parties has 70 secure seats and predicted to win 73 seats. This figure includes Queensland's Liberal National Party and the Northern Territory's Country Liberal Party, both of which are mergers of the local branches of the Liberal and National parties.
 The Australian Greens have picked up their first seat at a general election in the House of Representatives. Adam Bandt is projected to become the member for the Division of Melbourne. The Greens vote in the Senate reached 12.95%, meaning 1.26 million Australians voted for the party in the upper house. Its predicted tally of nine senators will guarantee it the balance of power in the Senate.
 Two days after the election, a handful of seats are still in doubt. Sky News and ABC report that three seats are in doubt, while the Australian Electoral Commission lists four.
 Rob Oakeshott, a re-elected independent, told ABC Television that he and the other independents want a stable government. ""If we can't get that, let's go back to the ballot box,"" he said.
 ""At the launch of our campaign this morning we had representatives from the Opposition, the shadow minister for youth as well as the Greens spokesperson for youth showing that this is not about who people vote for, it's about the fact that they've got the chance to vote,"" said Prime Minister Julia Gillard as she launched the campaign five weeks ago.
 The ALP came to power in 2007 after they won 83 seats in the House of Representatives under the leadership of Kevin Rudd. In July 2010, Rudd was replaced as leader of the ALP and as Prime Minister by Ms Gillard.
 Tony Abbott became leader of the Liberal Party of Australia in December 2009 replacing Malcolm Turnbull, who had replaced Brendan Nelson two years previously.

"," The Australian Senate has passed legislation to force a national nuclear waste dump on the Northern Territory (NT). Despite opposition from Aboriginal land owners, the NT government, environment groups and Labor the Federal Government can now officially build a nuclear waste repository in the NT after the legislation for the waste dump passed the Senate today. The Radioactive Waste Management Bill was passed with 34 in favour and 29 against.
 The two bills override the Northern Territory's objection to the radioactive waste dump after the South Australian government opposed a previous preferred site near Woomera. According to Federal Labor opposition MP, Warren Snowdon, it is the first time since 1978 that Territory law has been overridden. ""It's an absolute disaster and it shows contempt for the Northern Territory community, it shows absolute contempt for land use planning in the Northern Territory,"" he said. 
 The Territory Labor Government has been a resolute opponent of the plan, saying a nuclear dump will expose residents to a new security threat. 
 The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Clare Martin, says transporting nuclear waste to the Territory would make it vulnerable to terrorists looking to make a dirty bomb. Ms Martin says experts on the issue have raised concerns about security at a national nuclear waste facility.
 She says scientific debate played no part in the Federal Government's decision to build a dump in the Territory and nuclear waste could be a target while it is being moved to the Territory. ""You'd have to look at how far around a country you're going to be transporting things like intermediate nuclear level waste,"" she said. 
 ""And if you're going to put such a nuclear facility in the middle of central Australia you've got to get the waste there by road and that's thousands of kilometres."" She says the Commonwealth should not expect any cooperation from her Government.
 The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation's (ANSTO) Craig Pierce says there would be no point trying to use low level waste to make a dirty bomb because the waste is mostly gloves and labcoats. ""It simply would make no sense to get this material and want to blow it up,"" he said.
 ""It would have no impact at all. On the intermediate level, that will have a high level of security when it is transported. It won't be transported for very far on road, on land, and it will have an appropriate level of security."" 
 The Australian Conservation Foundation said it expected community anger would escalate, now the bills had passed. ""Last year the federal government gave the people of the NT an absolute categorical assurance there would be no dump in the NT,"" ACF nuclear campaigner Dave Sweeney said. ""Today they have broken this promise and bulldozed through bad law in an attempt to gag community concern.""
 ""Under the government's proposal, 130 truckloads of radioactive waste would be driven from Sydney's Lucas Heights reactor, through NSW, to an as-yet unnamed site in the NT in the first year alone, with dumping to continue for decades,"" he said.
 The Australian Greens say the legislation could be manipulated to allow waste from other countries to be stored in the Northern Territory. The party is angry that amendments they proposed were not considered when the bill was passed. Greens Senator Rachel Siewert says the legislation is not strong enough. 
 ""In the bill, there were some provisions to supposedly keep out international waste,"" she said. ""We don't think they go far enough and that they are open to manipulation and interpretation. So what we were trying to do is absolutely positively ensure that international waste will not be brought into this facility.""
 The NT Environment Centre's Gary Scott has hinted at civil disobedience similar to that seen during the anti-uranium mining protests at Jabiluka. ""I don't think Territorians are going to take this lying down unless that is in front of bulldozers,"" Mr Scott said.
 The Centre’s Peter Robertson has emphasised the importance of the waste dump for the federal government to realise its plans for a second nuclear reactor. ""If we get the dump, Sydney gets the reactor"". Establishing a national waste dump is a precondition for the operating license for the proposed OPAL nuclear reactor which will replace Lucas Heights in Sydney.
 Robertson pointed out that the issue of waste is creating an international crisis for the nuclear industry, with no storage plans for the more than 250,000 tonnes of high-level radioactive waste currently in existence. 
 A detailed study of three Defence sites - Fishers Ridge, 43 km south-east of Katherine, Harts Range, 100 km north-east of Alice Springs, and Mount Everard, 27 km north-west of Alice Springs - will be conducted next year, with the facility to be operational by 2011.
 Traditional owners of Athenge Alhere - an estate group of the Arrernte Nation - have voiced their dissent to the nuclear dump and say they don’t want waste from Sydney's Lucas Heights nuclear reactor brought to their land. ""Because the land we take care of, because all our ancestors lived in this land and hunted on this land as well, so it's mainly because of the animals and the next generation of our kids and their children, so we still say no,"" traditional owner Benedict Stevens said.
 Coalition MPs, including Northern Territory Country Liberal senator Nigel Scullion, secured a number of amendments to the bill. They included the ability of the NT government and indigenous land councils to decide on other site options, a prohibition on the storage of high level and overseas waste and the free storage of the NT's own waste.
 The South Australian Government says tenacity staved off a nuclear dump on its land. SA Environment Minister, John Hill, says there could be a federal election before the facility's finally built. ""It will take them some time to construct this facility and that gives you some opportunities,"" he said. 
 Mr Hill says waste should be stored closer to Lucas Heights in Sydney where it is generated. Radioactive waste is currently stored at over 100 locations across the country, including in hospital basements in major capital cities and at universities.
 Update: NT farmers have threatened to take action if a site near their farms is selected for the dump. Fishers Ridge, south of Katherine, is one of three Commonwealth sites earmarked for the facility. Sharon Shaw's farm 12 kilometres from the Fishers Ridge site. ""The thing that worries us the most, it's on top of a Tindal Aquifer which really concerns us in the fact that there's many sink holes that turn up every wet as the ground is always shifting,"" she said. ""Any normal person without an environmental degree or anything would realise that this ground is unstable.""

"," The Australian Federal Government has proposed repealing sections of the Racial Discrimmination Act that make it unlawful to “offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate” another person or group  based on race. 
 Attorney-General George Brandis said during question time in the Australian Senate that amending section 18C of the Racial Discrimation Act 1975 was in the interest of freedom of speech, saying: “In a free country people do have rights to say things that other people find offensive or insulting or bigoted."" 
 The Government is proposing to retain intimidation due to race as an offence and create a new law making it illegal to “vilify another person” based on “race, colour or national or ethnic origin.”
 Prime Minister Tony Abbott supported the proposed amendment, saying: “Of course this Government is determined to try to ensure that Australia remains a free and fair and tolerant society, where bigotry and racism has no place. But we also want this country to be a nation where freedom of speech is enjoyed.”
 Members of the Opposition have spoken against the proposed amendment, with Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus saying “Senator Brandis has clearly revealed today he intends to give a green light to racist hate speech in Australia.""
 Indigenous Liberal MP Ken Wyatt expressed concern over the legislation, and warned he could vote against his own party. “For me, it is about not disabling a mechanism that makes people think carefully about the vilification of anyone or any group because they know there is a deterrent,"" said Wyatt.
 The proposed draft will undergo community consultation for a month, with Senator Brandis welcoming alterations, “I am acutely aware of the importance that in protecting freedom of speech, we don't send the wrong messages. I want as much community engagement as possible"". The legislation will be introduced to the Parliament of Australia in the budget session when it resumes on May 13.

"," Phillip Ruddock (Liberal, Berowra) moved a motion expressing this after Question Time today, which included a description of the devastation wrought on the area, the response by the Australian Government and the Australian Defence Force, and thanked the efforts of people for their ""willingness to roll up their sleeves and get on with the job of cleaning up and rebuilding their towns and centres.""
 The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley (Labor, Brand) supported the motion, and congratulated the move to put General Peter Cosgrove in charge of operations, stating that soldiers ""know how to work through logistics issues...how to work around officialdom or blockages"", praised both local federal and state members of Parliament, and especially the Labor Queensland state premier, Peter Beattie.
 Bob Katter (Independent, Kennedy) was more critical in his speech. Katter thanked Beattie for his immediate response, but also described his confrontation with him and said how first responses were ""simply not working"", but also praised Beattie's decision on Cosgrove. Katter also described how the incident was ""the worst natural disaster in
Australian history"" and how the banana industry in north Queensland was decimated. Katter went on to describe the financial problems of the people in the region, the ""huge gap"" between the cost of rebuilding and insurance payouts, also asking ""Are we going to pay people virtually nothing to sit on their backsides to do nothing or are we going to pay them a decent wage and have them rebuilding our communities for us?""

"," The Australian Labor Party has accused speaker of the Australian House of Representatives, David Hawker (Liberal, Wannon) of failing to be impartial.
 During question time today, opposition leader, Kim Beazley (Labor, Brand) asked the government to confirm comments made by Cameron Thompson (Liberal, Blair), which asked for Prime Minister John Howard (Liberal, Bennelong) to explain his role in the failed merger of the Nationals and Liberals in Queensland. According to Mr Beazley, Mr Thompson claims that the president of the Liberal party in Queensland was appointed by Mr Howard and that his actions would have been known and agreed upon by the Prime Minister.
 The house's speaker refused to allow Mr Beazley to debate his question claiming it was not relevant. Mr Beazley argued that his question directly related to Mr Howard in his capacity as Prime Minister and to disallow his question was ""shutting down accountability"".
 The opposition's next woe came when Stephen Smith (Labor, Perth) asked the Prime Minister to confirm accusations that the government's new industrial relations laws (called Workchoices) had placed pressure on the low pay commission to lower the minimum wage of Australian workers. Mr Howard took the opportunity to attack Mr Beazley's role as Minister for Employment, Education and Training in 1993 saying that he had contempt for the unemployed.
 Anthony Albanese (Labor, Grayndler) raised a point of order, claiming that the Prime Minister's answer was irrelevant. This was refused by the speaker, who said that Mr Howard was attempting to answer a ""lengthy question"". Mr Albanese then interrupted Mr Howard as he was continuing his attack on Mr Beazley telling the speaker that the question was very specific and that Mr Howard's answer was irrelevant. Mr Albanese was ordered to resume his seat, and when he failed to do so was ordered out of the house.
 Following Mr Albanese's ejection, Mr Smith argued that the Prime Minister was not answering his question before also being ordered out of the house by the speaker. As Mr Howard began to continue his answer, Julia Irwin (Labor, Fowler) interrupted Mr Howard. Mrs Irwin was then ordered to leave the house.
 The opposition found itself another member short in the house after Julia Gillard (Labor, Lalor) was removed for calling Health Minister Tony Abbott (Liberal, Warringah) an ""idiot"". Ms Gillard's comment followed Mr Abbott tabling a document written by Medibank Private relating to a media campaign to counter negative views on its sale. Part of the document claimed that Medibank Private had ""established a hypothetical but possible scenario: Julia Gillard arguing that the sale will mean higher premiums"".
 Mr Abbott joked that ""Medibank Private sure know the member for Lalor (Julia Gillard)"".
 It was Ms Gillard's second ejection in two days. She was removed from the house yesterday for calling Mr Abbott a ""snivelling grub"", the same term Mr Abbott labeled an opposition MP last week without being removed.
 Following the house's question time, Mr Abbott and Peter Costello (Liberal, Higgins) accused Lindsay Tanner (Labor, Melbourne), Wayne Swan (Labor, Lilley) and Kim Wilkey (Labor, Swan) of deliberately blocking a camera's view of Mr Howard during one of his answers. Mr Tanner said ""It's not our fault he's short"" and Mr Wilkie said that he never raised from his chair and that Mr Abbott needed to ""get his facts straight"".
 Following her removal, Ms Gillard told reporters that speaker of the house, Mr Hawker had double standards. ""We've reached a stage ... where there are no rules in the House of Representatives,"" Ms Gillard said.
 ""Four Opposition members were tossed out of Parliament today. I don't think anybody watching question time could say that's a fair result.""
 ""We've seen double standards in operation all week"" she said.
 She said that it was not unusual for people to walk around the chamber and talk to each other during question while government members were speaking.
 ""At the end of the day there is wandering around and chatter in question time,"" she said.
 ""But why is that? Because the quality of what's coming off the government front bench doesn't bear listening to"" she said.

 Johnson discussed the earlier amendment to the Australian Marriage Act passed in 2004 that effectively removed the possibility for same-sex marriage, and continued that the failed efforts of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) to provide for civil unions within that state was a matter for ""grave alarm"". Johnson then argued against same-sex marriage saying that ""Children come from marriage and families stem from marriage"". Johnson criticized the earlier ACT legislation that provided for the dissolution of civil unions by letter to the ACT registrar, stating, ""Marriage is a lifelong commitment"". However, Johnson went on to discuss the breakdown of marriage and the status of single parents to argue, ""surely we all agree that the best environment for the rearing of children is one that has both a mother and a father"".
 Chris Hayes (Australian Labor Party, Division of Werriwa), took a different stance in speaking to the motion, by discussing how the Government's new industrial relation legislation, WorkChoices, would affect the balancing of work and family life, and called for industrial legislation that would ""support families into the future"". 
 Margaret May (Liberal, Division of McPherson), the seconder of the motion, recommenced arguing against same-sex marriage, calling it a ""social experiment"", and went on to state, ""Same sex relationships, or, indeed, unions should not have the same status as a marriage between a man and a woman"". May concluded her speech by calling for support to ""services to assist children, young people and adults and to continue sustaining safe, supportive and nurturing family relationships"".
 John Murphy (Labor, Division of Lowe) also affirmed support for heterosexual marriage, by stating, ""Marriage is a natural bond between man and woman, recognized in the vast majority of cultures, whether Christian or otherwise"", and added, ""nature ordains the natural procreative function of man and woman"". Murphy also addressed the amendments to the Marriage Act, saying, ""this definition is the only valid recognition of our civil laws, which correctly reflects the natural law and moral law"",  adding, ""You do not even have to believe in anything to draw that conclusion."" Murphy however stated in conclusion of his speech, ""we are all let down by those who … mask their support for marriage and who employ it as a weapon to attack the many other relationships in our society. Such attacks are unconscionable, unnecessary and unjustified.""
 Michael Ferguson (Liberal, Division of Bass) reiterated points raised by those before him, but also mentioned the issue of discrimination, saying, ""there is different treatment under the law for different relationships. But this is not about dicscrimination against the indivdual and it is not designed to be."" Ferguson continued to say, ""As individual people, homosexual men and women have exactly the same legal rights as you or I"".
 Craig Emerson (Labor, Division of Rankin) quoted a House Committee report To have and to hold -- strategies to strengthen marriage and relationships, saying that the report was bipartisan and added, ""the issue of marriage does enjoy bipartisan support in this parliament"", and reiterated Labor's support for the Marriage Amendment, which excluded the possibility for same-sex marriage. Emerson concluded his remarks by again tying the impact of the WorkChoices to family life.
 No other members of parliament spoke against or criticised the motion before debate was interrupted.
 Interestingly, the Australian Senate is yet to debate a motion moved by the Australian Democrats in order to repeal the Marriage Amendment discussed and institute same-sex marriage. The Australian Greens are also supportive of same-sex marriage, but neither of these parties hold seats in the House.

 On Thursday, Petro Georgiou (Kooyong, Liberal), Russell Broadbent (McMillan, Liberal) and Judi Moylan (Pearce, Liberal) crossed the floor to vote with the opposition against the government's proposed reforms. Two other coalition MPs abstained from the vote. The legislation still passed, due to the coalition's commanding majority in Australia's lower house.

 The government now needs all of these senators to vote for this bill because Steve Fielding from the Family First Party has now officially announced that he will vote aganist this bill because he disagrees with sending asylum seekers to Nauru instead of being processed in Australia
 Australia's major opposition party, the Australian Labor Party has urged coalition senators to follow the lead of their lower house counterparts and defeat the bill.

"," A package of six media reform bills introduced last week before Australia's Parliament — including one proposing appointing a Public Interest Media Advocate (PIMA) to monitor print and online sectors — was shelved yesterday by the Australian Labor Party, with only two passed before a seven week break for the country's legislative body. Stephen Conroy, the Minister  for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, had hoped to see the legislation package passed by the end of the week.
 The six-bill media advocacy legislation package, including Public Interest Media Advocate Bill 2013,  Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Convergence Review and Other Measures) Bill 2013,  Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (News Media Diversity) Bill 2013 which includes provisions related to news media and PIMA,  News Media (Self-regulation) (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2013 which would require media organisations to be registered with the government to enjoy protections traditionally enjoyed by journalists and the media,  News Media (Self-regulation) Bill 2013 which creates PIMA,  and Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 2013,  were introduced Thursday February 14 before the House Standing Infrastructure and Communications and the Senate Environment and Communications Legislation Committee.
 The Parliament of Australia summarized Public Interest Media Advocate Bill 2013 as, ""Part of a package of six bills in relation to the media sector, the bill: creates the independent statutory office of the Public Interest Media Advocate (PIMA); provides for the functions, appointment, and terms and conditions of PIMA; and requires an annual report to be prepared on PIMA’s activities and other specified matters."" Other bills in the package delineate what PIMA's role would be. Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Convergence Review and Other Measures) Bill 2013 and Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 2013 both had their second reading on Tuesday in the House and were the only bills to pass both houses of parliament.  Unlike the other bills in the package which have not had a third reading before being shelved, the former bill deals primarily with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and Special Broadcasting Service, while the latter bill increased licensing fees for television stations.
 On Monday, the Australian Associated Press (AAP) released a statement saying such government oversight is not required. Other Australian media organizations have protested the proposed legislation. Australia's The Daily Telegraph is quoted by the Brisbane Times describing this legislation as an ""aggressive attempt to silence your media.""
 Speaking before a Senate committee about media reform, AAP chief Bruce Davidson said, ""We simply do not believe that there is a problem with the conduct of the media in Australia, and certainly not that of AAP, that warrants further oversight by a minster-appointed body [...] Any hidden perception, I believe, of government interference is simply a dangerous precedent that may lead to control, may lead to interference [...] The aims may be noble, Mr Chairman, but the potential for potential misuse and changes of that legislation as presented to us, I think, is a dangerous thing to contemplate.""
 Former federal court judge Ray Finkelstein oversaw an inquiry into the Australian print media in 2011.  He told a government inquiry, ""There are no powerful groups in society that can come along to governments or anybody and say 'we can do what we like when we like and there's nothing you should do about it'."" Finkelstein is also on the record as stating that self regulation by the industry through their own organization has failed.

"," Ministers in Australia's federal government have lost the power to veto laws in the nation's two mainland territories after legislation passed the national parliament. The legislation requires for both chambers of the parliament to strike down laws made in the Northern Territory (NT) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) parliaments. 
 Previously government ministers could veto laws unilaterally. ""What that means is that it is no longer the case that the minister can step in with the stroke of a pen and dismiss territory laws as we've seen many instances before,"" Greens MP Adam Bandt said.
 The legislation is the first piece of Australian Greens-proposed federal legislation to be signed into law. Greens leader Senator Bob Brown said ""[this is a] very important milestone for democracy in the territories,"" he said.
 ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher welcomed the law change, saying that while the ACT government would continue to call for a joint territory-federal review into the self-government legislation, there was no need for a delay to ""sensible"" veto law changes. ""We've never felt that overturning the laws of a democratically elected government at the swipe of a pen was a fair situation.""
 The opposition attempted to change the legislation to prevent the legalisation of same-sex marriages in the territories, but Government frontbencher Craig Emerson told parliament that federal marriage laws made the amendment unnecessary.

"," Fighting words were exchanged in the Australian House of Representatives over the matter of the division of Medicare safety net payments per electorate. The Minister for Health and Ageing Tony Abbott (Liberal, Warringah) had introduced a policy that the Government would pay Medicare users up to a fixed amount — the safety net — to help in addressing ""gaps"" in certain payments which Medicare would not cover, such as certain hospital payments. The Opposition was opposed to the idea on efficacy counts.
 Abbott was asked a Dorothy Dixer in Question Time today about the benefits of the safety net. He alleged that criticism by the Opposition Health spokeswoman Julia Gillard (Labor, Lalor) that the safety net favoured Liberal/National Party coalition electorates was misleading as it was a Labor electorate, Grayndler that received the ""highest safety net benefits per electorate"".
 This led Gillard to make a personal explanation after Question Time, stating that ""the top four electorates receiving money under the Medicare safety net are Wentworth, North Sydney, Bradfield and Warringah"" — all coalition electorates. The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley (Labor, Brand), put a question to the Speaker of the House, David Hawker (Liberal, Wannon) asking of the Speaker his ""assurance that no person is being deliberately misled by the actions of any other person"". 
 Abbott had then interjected towards Beazley, saying ""You big bellowing cow""; the Speaker asked Abbott to withdraw, but Abbott mentioned that ""the Leader of the Opposition regularly interjects 'pompous ass' and 'goose', but I am happy to withdraw"". Beazley then responded through the Speaker saying of Abbott, ""I think that he is a sleazy, dummy-spitting, little git.""
 Abbott then made a personal explanation of his own, saying ""The safety net benefit per person in the electorate of the member for Grayndler was $591, the highest in New South Wales...the safety net benefit in the electorate of Sydney  was $589, the second highest...the benefit in the electorate of Lowe was $458, the third highest"".
 The matter was not further raised at the time, but after the Matter of Public Importance debate, Gillard moved a motion to suspend standing orders which would prevent Abbott from explaining his earlier claim ""when this claim is totally untrue"", to correct the ""grossly inaccurate and misleading statement"", to ""apologise to all Members in this place"" and to ""apologize to the Member for Grayndler and his constituents"". Gillard also listed the amounts of payments ""released by the Minister himself"", that Wentworth received $7.8 million, North Sydney received $7.5 million, Bradfield received $6.9 million, Warringah received $6.3 million; whereas Grayndler received only $3.6 million. She attempted to debate the motion but a gag motion to silence Gillard was moved and won because of Government numbers. Anthony Albanese, the Labor member for Grayndler attempted to second the motion but the gag was moved on him as well. The final vote on the motion was lost 55 to 79.

"," The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has launched an investigation into the Nine Network over comments by its football commentators regarding the government's planned poker machine reform.
 An ACMA statement yesterday read: ""ACMA has confirmed that it is investigating a complaint that Channel Nine broadcast political material without adequately identifying it as such during the NRL first preliminary final"".
 The comments, made during an NRL football match on September 23, saw Nine’s commentators Ray Warren and Phil Gould criticizing the reforms, labeling pokie reform as ""rubbish"". Mr Gould added ""I’ve never seen a more stupid policy in all my life.""
 Networks are required to acknowledge political comment when broadcast as a condition of their licenses. ""The identification of political material usually takes the form of a statement following the material advising on whose behalf the material had been broadcast"", the ACMA statement noted.
 Proposed reforms to poker machines will see gamblers forced to pre-commit to a limit on their losses, or instead use low-intensity poker machines with $1 bets.
 Shelly Bates, Nine Network’s compliance manager, claimed, as reported by ABC's Media Watch, ""The comments relating to the Federal Government proposed poker machine tax were purely the opinions of the commentators regarding matters directly affecting the NRL community"".  Mr Warren previously told Austereo's Triple M that the comments were ""a directive from up top ... [to] be read by at least somebody"" adding,  ""I think it was done on behalf of the [National] Rugby League, who is fully supportive of the clubs.""
 On Monday, independents in the Australian Parliament Andrew Wilkie and Nick Xenophon wrote to David Gyngell, chief executive of the Nine Network, accusing the network of ""attempting to mislead (and alarm) viewers"", and of breaching the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, the Broadcasting Services Act, and the Electoral Act. Nine responded with a statement yesterday, ""The Nine Network will be providing Messrs Wilkie and Xenophon with a detailed and considered response on the issues they have raised, and we are confident we are not in breach of any code provisions.""
 If ACMA rules Nine in breach of its license conditions the watchdog may impose a fine or further license conditions, demand action to prevent further breaches, or even suspend or cancel the network's license.

"," Australian Labor leader Bill Shorten announced today, they will present a private bill to Parliament next Monday to legalise same-sex marriage, with the support of deputy leader Tanya Plibersek.
 This move towards same-sex marriage follows the Greens' initial announcement this morning, saying they planned senate debate of a marriage equality bill in June.
 Bill Shorten announced his plan to bring same-sex marriage to Australia through a statement, saying, ""I have given notice that I will move a Private members Bill in the House of Representatives on Monday which will finally bring about marriage equality in Australia"".
 The Irish referendum which saw a majority of voting citizens support same-sex marriage over the weekend has brought the issue back to the front of public debate In Australia.
 On the possibility of a similar process in Australia, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said, ""Referendums are held in this country where there's a proposal to change the constitution [...] I don't think anyone is suggesting the constitution needs to be changed in this respect."" 
 In order for the bill to pass through Parliament, votes are not only needed from the Labor party, but also the Coalition MPs. Tony Abbott has said it is up to the Coalition party room whether MPs will be permitted to have a conscience vote, rather than being required to vote their parties' position.
 Talking about the effect the private bill will have, along with the freedom to vote, Bill Shorten says, ""It will challenge the deeply held personal beliefs of MPs and senators on both sides of politics. This is why Labor members have the freedom to vote their conscience, a freedom Tony Abbott is currently denying his party.""

"," The Australian House of Representatives heard the traditional right-of-reply to the Budget released May 9, from the Australian Labor Party, led by Kim Beazley (Labor, Brand), plus Budget replies from minor parties in the Australian Senate.
 While the Budget is politically popular, having as one of its main features significant tax reform, Beazley focused on the omissions in the Budget, such as the failure to address a skills shortage.
 Beazley opened by stating that ""This budget fails middle Australia and mortgages our kids' future"", and continued by stating that ""after ten long years, they deserve a break"" from the Howard Government.
 Beazley introduced the key idea of his Budget reply by speaking directly to middle Australia, ""Tonight I seek a binding agreement between us… Australia is counting on you to do the next round of heavy lifting… relying on you to drive a new wave of economic prosperity… under a Beazley labor government, when you put in, you get back"".
 Beazley contrasted that idea by criticising the Treasurer, saying that after five budgets without a decent tax break, which was affected already by ""soaring petrol prices"", likening him to a poker machine with a payout of only ""ten bucks"".
 Beazley's commented solicited applause from the galleries, and continued sporadically through his reply, which focused on five points:
 Beazley also announced the founding of an independent expert body on infrastructure, and a ""Building Australia"" fund to invest in infrastructure.
 In his conclusion, he stated his ""unshakable faith in the Australian people"", and criticised the Government's failure to ""deal with climate change now"", the Government's mishandling of foreign debt, rising up to ""half a trillion dollars"" -- Beazley likened Costello to Wile. E. Coyote, with an anvil about to drop on his head.
 Beazley welcomed the tax cuts, but noted the influence of rising oil prices and  student debt. Beazley also noted that he would not have spent the money on the Iraq war and would not have paid money to Saddam's regime, referring to the AWB scandal.
 Beazley's speech ended in further applause.
 Senator Lyn Allison (Australian Democrats, Victoria), the Leader of the Democrats, was the first to speak in the Senate on the Budget.
 Allison stated that the Budget was developed through the eyes of ""political strategists"" and was developed with ""little interest in the social, economic, and environmental mess left behind"".
 Allison criticised the Government, stating that ""manufacturing can't compete against cheap imports"", criticised size of the trade deficit and foreign debt, noted the lack of the Budget to address high petrol prices, noted that bankruptcies are at their highest, and high household debt, saying that ""you won't read about them in this budget"".
 Allison argued that ""surplus should have been invested in the future"", to address climate change, student debt which was ""burdening generations with personal debt"", and strongly criticised the Government in regard to its failure to fund education, saying it was ""an act of vandalism"".
 Allison said that the Budget was a Budget ""for buying votes, not for the long-term future of the nation"".
 
Allison continued to describe how the Government had lost its environmental credentials, stating that the ""environment in much better hands when the Democrats held the balance of power"".
 Allison responded to the Budget allowances for transport infrastructure, saying that the Budget ""ignoring public transport"" and that freeway funding was not sustainable.
 Allison argued that the income tax cuts introduced in the Budget were ""rewarding those on the highest incomes the most"". In response to the mental health provisions in the Budget, she stated that more must be done on mental health, smoking, obesity related disease, and said that the Treasurer's ""generosity was not extended to the PBS"".
 She noted how the Government was ""cynically failing indigenous Australians"", describing a Government scheme of an assistance payment to indigenous Australians which was based on attendance at schools, and that the Government had revised the total amount of payment downward based on the expectations that indigenous Australians will not attend schools.
 Ellison concluded by stating that ""The Democrats are committed to what we know to be the priorities for a sustainable future for all Australians, well beyond a Costello next decade and most definitely beyond the next election.""
 Senator Christine Milne (Tasmania, Australian Greens) presented the Australian Greens budget reply speech.
 She begun by describing how the Howard Government had said they had ""delivered rivers of gold and manna from heaven"", and that the Budget message was such that ""people were prompted to rejoice and be glad to spend, spend, spend"".
 Milne went on to say that Australia had become ""two nations...one that is fixated on the present and cannot see what the problem is and the other that can see the problem and the huge risks for our children, grandchildren and future generations.""
 Milne noted that the capacity of the environment to provide and fuel economic growth by traditional means ""is in doubt"". She went on to criticse the squandering of a ""a minerals boom which has delivered corporate profits to the Treasury"", stating that the money should have been spent on ""nation-building"".
 Milne went on to criticise Australia's interest in nuclear power and criticised Australia's export of uranium, and noted the impact of salinity and climate change, and called for the establishment of a ""climate change disaster fund"".
 Milne responded to the AusLink funding proposed by the Government Budget, by also criticising the lack of development in public transport. Milne also echoed Ellison's criticism of the Government's treatment of its indigenous population, stating ""If we cannot address Aboriginal disadvantage in an economic boom time, when can we address it?""
 Milne concluded by stating ""the Greens’ vision for Australia and the values we hold mean we would not squander the surplus on a spending spree. We do not support the tax cuts or superannuation windfall for high-income earners."" and reiterated the points of view that the Greens felt needed addressing.
 Stephen Fielding (South Australia, Family First Party) was the final Senator to speak on the Budget in the Senate. 
 He criticised the lack of support for low and middle income earners, stating ""The government claims this is a budget for families, but the big winners are the high-income earners"", and reiterated his earlier calls for reduction in fuel price by ""10c a litre"". 
 Fielding noted that Family First supported the fact that more families would receive benefits, but called for a greater increase in the benefit rather than ""the child-care rebate, which only goes to parents of children attending formal child care"".
 Fielding concluded by noting that ""Families do benefit from this budget and will welcome it. But, for the average Australian family, this budget will not be the bonanza the government would like us all to believe it is.""

"," The Economics Legislation Committee of the Australian Senate reported Tuesday on their investigation into the matter of investigating the benefits of religious charities in Australia, and recommended the formation of a Charities Commission. The recommendation has received bipartisan support. The inquiry began as the result of legislation initially introduced in the Senate by Senator Nick Xenophon after he had received complaints from former members of the Scientology organization in Australia.
 The Charities Commission recommended by the Australian Senate Committee would have responsibilities including investigating charitable organizations in order to make sure that their business dealings were forthright. Such organizations would be required to prove they were worthy of maintaining charitable status from the government.
 Senator Xenophon commented that the recommendation would begin a process towards increasing accountability of these organizations, ""I believe reform is now inevitable. We can't continue to have business as usual when it comes to organisations that have been beyond any reasonable level of accountability."" 
 He emphasized such inquiry came about due to controversial revelations from former members of the Church of Scientology, ""This inquiry came about because of legislation I introduced for a public benefit test for religions and charities, and it was as a direct result of being approached by many victims of the Church of Scientology. Their evidence, their complaints played a key role in triggering this inquiry.""
 Senator Xenophon said that recommendations included in the Report served as a warning to cult-like organizations such as the Church of Scientology. The Report requested that the Attorney-General of Australia investigate laws relating to cults in the country. The ""Tax Laws Amendment (Public Benefit Test) Bill 2010"" was introduced into the Senate by Senator Xenophon in May 2010; the Economics Legislation Committee investigated this proposed legislation and completed a report on the matter in the form of a series of recommendations for the new government in Australia to consider.
 A member of the inquiry committee itself, Senator Xenophon pointed out that the recommendations of the Report went beyond the scope of his initial proposed legislation through a recommendation that a Charities Commission use a ""Public Benefit Test"" in order to assess non-profit organizations active in the country. Senator Xenophon provided an addendum to the Report in the form of a special notes section, wherein he wrote that due to the nature of the disturbing accounts told before the committee regarding controversial activities of organizations in the country, legislation to set up a Charities Commission should be completed before June 30, 2011.
 The Committee's Report included recommendations regarding concerns about controversial activities of cult-like organizations. The Report stated there was sufficient evidence heard before the Committee such that the activities of cults should be investigated in the country with the goal of forming policy broader than simply with respect to taxation laws. For the purposes of the Committee's investigation, the Macquarie Dictionary was cited to define the term cult as, ""A religious or pseudo-religious movement, characterised by the extreme devotion of its members, who usually form a relatively small, tightly controlled group under an authoritarian and charismatic leader.""
 With regard to behaviour of cults in the country, the Committee recommended the Attorney-General report on operations of governmental organization which investigate these groups such as the French government organization, MIVILUDES. The recommendation to the Attorney-General stated, ""The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department provide a report to the Committee on the operation of Miviludes and other law enforcement agencies overseas tasked with monitoring and controlling the unacceptable and/or illegal activities of cult-like organisations who use psychological pressure and breaches of general and industrial law to maintain control over individuals."" 
 In the summary and recommendations section of the Report, the Committee concluded, ""Religions and charities, and other not-for-profit organisations ... play an important role in the community and in the economy. They receive significant tax concessions. It is therefore important that they are transparent and appropriately accountable.""

"," The Australian Senate has been flooded with submissions into an inquiry about the possible use of the abortion drug Mifepristone (known as RU486) in Australia.
 The senate committee is to consider a private members bill, introduced by a group of female senators and MPs to strip the Australian health minister of his control over the drug. If successful, the drug would then have to be approved by the Threrapeutic Goods Administration before it would be allowed to be used in Australia.
 Senator Fiona Nash of the Nationals argues that the bill is not about abortion but about process. She said ""What's been put forward here is who is best able to judge the quality, safety and efficacy of this particular drug and who is best able to judge whether it should be used in Australia"".
 Ms Nash believes that the TGA should be responsible for allowing or denying the use of drugs in Australia, not the health minister.
 Lyn Elisson, leader of the Democrats said that only around 2,000 of the submissions would be considered as the remainder do not meet the senate's terms of reference. She also said ""This bill is not about the morality or legality of abortion.
 ""It's really about whether the Minister for Health should have the power of veto over an alternative to legal surgical abortion.""
 National's senator Barnaby Joyce argues that all opinions should be taken into account and that the enquiry should be conducted for at least a week.
 Peter Slipper, MP for the Liberal party claims that the proposed legislation can not be separated from the RU486 issue. He told ABC radio ""I believe it would be a negation of our responsibility if we were to flick the decision to an unelected body, an unaccountable body, such as the TGA.""
 It is believed that only 100 submissions are from those supporting the use of RU486.
 The inquiry has received international attention with submissions from the US, New Zealand and Austria.
This pill has been available for use in France since 1988, in Switzerland since 1999.

Key senator Barnaby Joyce has expressed his support of the bill due to his influencing Government amendments dealing with public holidays. Non-Government senators expressed their concerns yesterday and today in regard to these amendments — Family First Party senator Stephen Fielding introduced amendment to try and complement the Government amendments, but the Government has expressed that they will not be supporting them as they do not contain ""right to refuse"" provisions.
 The Senate had not finished debate on all the amendments in the nine page outline of business before 4.30 pm, the time set by the earlier guillotine, and the amendments were consequently put without debate. Non-Government members did not pursue divisions on all the amendments other than key ones.

may have just gone out in the Senate chamber, but they
do not go out on the labour movement!"". Persons in the gallery of the Senate were applauding to non-Government speeches, which brought about support from the Opposition and skepticism from Government senators saying that ""no amount of guffaws from those who have been trundled in here today to stand up the back will change the fact that we have been re-elected four times by Australian working men and women.""

 ""The potential precedents for this are enormous,"" said the head of a major news agency. ""This will set a global benchmark — it has been coming to a head for a long time.""
 The inquiry was set up off the back of a feud between sporting organisations and media outlets over the use of footage, some of which was uploaded to YouTube, and photos taken at sporting events. It will also look at whether companies who own broadcast rights can get a commercial return by limiting the use of their footage.
 Agence France-Presse, Reuters and Australian Associated Press boycotted the Australian cricket season because Cricket Australia required them to sign documents restricting the use of photos and video footage they [AFP, Reuters and AAP] collected. Journalists working for Fairfax Media and News Limited were almost banned from covering the 2006-07 Ashes Series after their respective organisations refused to sign accreditation documents. The issue was resolved.
 ""This is a matter that has been of immense concern to the media all over the world and control over access to events is being used to control access to images,"" said Chris Warren, secretary of the Media, Entertainment & Arts Alliance (MEAA). He said that many Australians were unaware of how agreements were limiting their access to sports coverage.
 A Wikinews reporter was able to get accreditation for the 2008-09 A-League Finals series. The reporter captured video footage and photos with his own camera. The video footage used was released under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike and GNU Free Documentation License copyright licenses.

The Australian Federal Opposition has hounded the Treasurer, Peter Costello, over the appointment of Robert Gerard to the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board. Mr Gerard announced on Friday 2nd that he will resign from the Board, citing the events of this week as the reason.
"," On Tuesday, November 29, Wayne Swan, the Shadow Treasurer asked of Costello in the first question of Question Time about an apparent statement that Costello made to Gerard, namely, ""I know there's an issue with the Tax Office but I don't have a problem with you on the board"". Costello responded that he had no problem with Gerard, noting that ""he brings a great understanding of Australian manufacturing industry to the board"", and that the obligatory declaration of interest was ""indeed was signed by Mr Gerard"".
 Later it was said by Swan in the House of Representatives that Gerard's company was using ""tax havens as tax avoidance schemes to the value of $150 million"" and that the declaration of interest mentioned was only in regard to his personal affairs and on asking the Treasurer when he knew this, claimed that him actually knowing the information ""would breach the secrecy act"". Later Swan revealed that Gerard ""and his corporate vehicles"" have been ""susbtantial donors"" to the Liberal Party. Costello maintained that the Government ""[does] not think that supporting the Liberal Party is a disqualification from holding ministerial office, prime ministerial office, Treasury office or other offices in Australia""
 Swan moved a censure motion to ""provide this House with a full and proper explanation of...his communications with Mr Robert Gerard...and his knowledge of Mr Robert Gerard's dispute with the Australian Taxation Office..."", which failed in the Government's favour with votes 83 to 59 in division.
 On Wednesday, November 30, Swan opened the House in a movement to suspend standing orders again to get information from the Treasurer, stating that ""The Treasurer is in real strife"" before the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer moved the gag. In Question Time, the Opposition continued to ask every question in regard to the appointment of Gerard.  The Leader of the Opposition Kim Beazley revealed in his question to the Treasurer that ""some of his cabinet colleagues have privately said that they did not consider Mr Gerard was 'a good choice' in the first place for the Reserve Bank board"". The Treasurer responded that Gerard's ""appointment was supported by all
members of the cabinet""
 In the subsequent Matters of Public Importance debate, the matter selected was that proposed by Wayne Swan, namely, ""The need for the Treasurer to uphold the highest standards of probity in the selection of candidates for the Reserve Bank Board.""
 On Thursday, December 1, the Opposition again reserved a number of its questions for inquiring about Gerard's appointment. Swan revealed in a question to the Treasurer that Gerard Corporation had ""acquired an investment company in the tax haven of the British Virgin Islands eight months after the Treasurer recommended his appointment to the Reserve Bank board"". Costello responded to Swan referring him to ""a statement about that allegation in the Australian Financial Review today...in which he makes it clear that no income
has been derived.""
 Later, the Leader of the Opposition tried to move a censure motion on the treasurer, but leave of the House was not granted, so he had to resort to moving a motion to suspend standing orders to move the same motion, to censure the Treasurer for his appointment.

 The Minister for Workplace Relations, Kevin Andrews, however focused elsewhere on the MPI, and drew the attention of the Australian Labor Party's ties to the unions, had described the Opposition as a ""policy free zone"", said that ""there is one group that represents privilege in this place and that is the Australian Labor Party"", and stressed the benefits of WorkChoices.
 Craig Emerson noted that the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party participated in ""deliberate tax evasion"", and that Mr Gerard ""paid penalty tax in circumstances of deliberate tax evasion"".  Emerson later said that the Liberal Party was ""soft on tax cheats"", ""soft on tax cheating Liberal Party donors...and members"".
 The adjournment debate also brought up criticism of Gerard's appointment in the adjournment debate.  Christopher Bowen noted the ""disquiet"" in the media, and noted the previous Board member Bernie Fraser also calling for his dismissal.

"," Yesterday, Greg Barns was named Australia's WikiLeaks Party national campaign director following the party receiving support from philanthropist Philip Wollen of Melbourne.
 Barns is not new to political campaigning; the barrister served as the leader of Australian Republican Movement during the late 1990s and served as a Liberal Party of Australia staffer. Barns was personally asked by Julian Assange to take the position, following Assange's own announcement late last year that he would run for a federal Senate seat in Victoria. John Shipton is already serving as the party's secretary. 
 Barns said the WikiLeaks Party's federal platform will focus on several issues including human rights, freedom of speech, privacy issues, and government transparency. The Wikileaks Party has not been registered yet with the Australian Electoral Commission as they do not have 500 enrolled electors as of today.
 Assange is still based in London in the Ecuadorian Embassy, where he has been living for the last nine months.  Assange would need approximately 15% of the Victorian vote to win a senate seat.  Voting in Australia is compulsory.

"," Last Friday, following over two years of lawsuit over failure to participate in general election, Anders Holmdahl attended a High Full Court of Australia hearing with an audio-link from Canberra to Adelaide, South Australia, claiming voting is a right, not a duty, citing the Australian constitution. However the Justices dismissed the application for leave to appeal against conviction, ruling it had ""no prospect of success"" over a point that the Commonwealth Electoral Act was enacted within power.
 Anders Holmdahl was represented by  Kevin Borick, QC, the president of the Australian Criminal Lawyers Association, throughout the process.
 Anders Holmdahl cited ""fundamental distinction"" between the words vote, which he defined as ""exercise of free will""; right, ""something you are privileged to be granted""; and duty, ""something you are required to do"". After a 20-minute discourse with the lawyer representing the applicant, Justice Kenneth Hayne said, ""An appeal to this Court would enjoy no prospect of success. Special leave to appeal is refused."" and adjourned the Court. Justices Stephen Gageler, Patrick Keane were also present at the hearing and participated in the verbal discourse, also enquiring the lawyer about their reasoning but not specifying reasons other than what Hayne J said. Wikinews contacted both Anders Holmdahl and the High Court and confirmed there was no other documentation of reasons behind the judgment.
 The standard High Court procedures involve hearing each matter by a single Justice and only escalating it after a special leave to appeal is granted. The current case had been irregular, as the matter had been escalated to the Full Court (three Justices) directly.
 The appeal also had exhausted lower means of appeal before being lodged in High Court; the Supreme Court of South Australia had dismissed it on September 24, 2012. It cited that the Australian Constitution allows each state to enact their own election laws, and the Federal Parliament has the power to make laws ""with respect to ... matters in respect of which this Constitution makes provision until the Parliament otherwise provides"". The Court concluded that the Commonwealth Electoral Act was legislation enacted within power.
 Prior to escalation to the Supreme Full Court of South Australia, in May 2012, a single Justice Gray had forwarded the matter for consideration of Full Court (three Judges) at his discretion. This happened several months after a Magistrate had recorded the conviction following a trial in February 2012. Anders Holmdahl originally pleaded not guilty during his first Magistrates court appearance in December 2011 regarding the August 21, 2010 election.
 The electoral system of Australia requires all citizens to enroll. Then they must vote at each general election — election of members of the House of Representatives and Senate of the Parliament of Australia. At the time of the election, Anders Holmdahl was enrolled as an elector on the Commonwealth Electoral Roll for the Division of Hindmarsh.
 The High Full Court hearing was a last instance of appeal with further escalation only possible at international level. Anders Holmdahl had decided to take the case before the United Nations Human Rights Council.

"," The Senator Julian McGauran in the Australian Senate had made an ""unseemly"" gesture across the floor of the Senate whilst it was in session on August 11, apparently as a result of interjections about a division taking place.
 Whilst this was not immediately debated, Senator Bob Brown had asked the Acting Deputy President of the Senate to look into the matter[1]. Later the President of the Senate ruled that the gesture was ""unseemly but not obscene""[2]. 
 This ruling caused a fierce debate, with Senator Brown saying that McGauran's ""arrogant and disgusting""[3] actions exemplified the Government's attitude towards its new-found Senate majority, whilst Senator Ron Boswell, the National Party Senate leader, had criticised Brown of hypocrisy, stating that Brown had ""broken every law in Australia"" and ""every law in Tasmania""[4] (which Bartlett noted as a point of order as being hyperbole).
 Senator McGauran then spoke, stating that he ""regret[ted] his actions""[5]. Brown however noted that this was not an unqualified apology. A motion was then put that the President's ruling be dissented from, which debate was set for another sitting. Senator Chris Evans, the Labor Senate leader and Senator Brown had called for McGauran's sacking as Chief Government whip; his National Party superiors have said that they will speak to McGauran about the incident.

 The House session became tumultuous, with the Leader of the House Tony Abbott moving a motion to permit an hour to the consideration in detail stage of the bill, comparing the amount of debate on other bills to this one, stating ""we have had very, very extensive debate"" and that ""members opposite are not interested in debating this bill, they are not interested in trying to improve this bill; they simply want to reject this bill"". The Manager of Opposition Business in the House, Julia Gillard (Abbott's opposition counterpart), had noted that ""more than 20 Labor members are going to be silenced by this motion which is gagging debate"", and when Abbott moved to put the question, ""and, here we go, we are going to have a gag on a gag. You’re proud of that, are you? You’re proud of that?""
 As Annette Ellis amongst others was one of the aforementioned speakers who had not the time to speak in the debate, she asked whether she could incorporate her speech into Hansard — the Government granted leave for all speakers who intended to speak but could not to incorporate their speeches into Hansard.
 In the consideration in detail stage, the Federal Opposition had moved a number of amendments to the legislation, one which would effectively — as Stephen Smith had put it — ""kill the bill"", another which would rename the bill to the ""Workplace Relations Amendment (Cut Wages, Cut Conditions and Entitlements, No Fairness, No Work Choices) Bill 2005"", but this amendment was ruled out of order by the Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives, David Hawker.

"," Leader of the Federal Opposition in Australia Tony Abbott has made claims Thursday during Question Time in parliament that a 'people's revolt' is looming based on the Prime Minister Julia Gillard's proposal for a 2012 carbon tax.
 In what Mr. Abbott describes as a ""betrayal of the Australian people"", Ms. Gillard announced Thursday that a price for carbon will be put back on the national agenda, for several years, to be followed by the formation of an emissions trading scheme. In the lead up to the 2010 Federal Australian Election, Ms. Gillard claimed that while she might implement a green house gas reduction scheme, ""[she would] rule out a carbon tax"".
 The price on carbon will be applied to industrial and transport emissions but will not, however, affect Australia's agriculture.  
 The Prime Minister's announcement resulted in a large portion of Question Time being devoted to the issue with a Member of the Opposition being expelled from the House for disorderly conduct. Mr. Abbot then moved to censure the Prime Minister and conclude Question Time claiming ""Nothing is more fake than making a promise to the Australian people before the election and breaking it after the election ... I don't believe it's going to happen because I think there will be a people's revolt. They will see this as an assault on their standard of living, which is exactly what it is"".
 To which the Prime Minister responded ""Increasingly Australians understand that the  Liberal Party, under the Leader of the Opposition, is a party of the past with no real policies or plans for the nation's future ... You get judged ultimately in this Parliament by what you decide to do and what you deliver, and on this side of the Parliament we are determined that from July 1 (2012) we will price carbon.""
 The Opposition claims that the proposed carbon tax will cause petrol prices to rise by A$0.065 per litre while energy bills may increase by $300 per year.

"," The ongoing debate over whether the Australian Health Minister Tony Abbott, or the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) regulate the abortifacient mifepristone (RU486) has complicated with a number of members proposing amendments to the Senate bill, now in the House of Representatives.
 Jackie Kelly (Australian Liberal Party, Lindsay) has said that ""There should be a transparent process in which the minister is accountable for his or her decision"" on so-called restricted goods (of which RU486 is such a good) as listed in the TGA legislation. Kelly has proposed an amendment with points stating that ""the Minister for Health and Ageing continuing to have the decision making role in relation to the approval of restricted goods..."", ""the Minister being required to obtain written advice from the Therapeutic Goods Administration prior to giving written approval or refusal to approve"", ""the Minister's decision being subject to disallowance"".
 In the debate on February 14, Andrew Laming (Liberal, Bowman) noted his intent to propose an amendment in the later consideration in detail stage, noting his views that the TGA process is ""so far removed...from the concerns and the beliefs of the community"" and that he is ""unable to convince [himself] that completely leaving these decisions to the TGA is the right thing to do"". His amendment loosely aims to propose a ""disallowable instrument in Parliament where there is a disagreement with the findings of the TGA.""
 The introduction of amendments has caused confusion on procedural matters February 15 in the Questions to the Speaker period (that follows Question Time), where members can ask questions of the Speaker on procedural and other technical matters. In the following vote on the proposed legislation, if one of the votes on the amendments succeeds, this has the effect of discontinuing the other amendment proposals, as each of the amendments proposed has the effect of being a complete alternative bill.
 The RU486 debate will have precedence over all other matters in the House until it is dealt with. Voting is expected on Thursday.

 The first speakers have been all women speaking in support of passing control from the Health Minister to the TGA: Australian National Party Senator Fiona Nash, Australian Democrats Senator Lyn Allison, Australian Labor Party Senator Claire Moore. They have drawn attention to the fact that abortion is already legal in Australia, the inappropriateness of a Parliament minister to regulate a single drug versus a scientific and independent body, and if RU486 is an unsafe drug then the TGA will not approve the drug. Petitions were presented by Moore with the undersigned stating ""medical experts, not the health minister"" should regulate the drug.
 Australian Liberal Party Senator Gary Humphries then spoke, stating that the bill is a ""mistake"", not because of the possible risks, or that the TGA is unfit to perform the evaluation, but because RU486 is ""not just another drug"", ""facilitating a medical procedure that is not just a medical procedure"". Australian Greens Senator Kerry Nettle spoke in favour of the bill, making mention of views of others on the supposed push polling of some groups opposing the bill. Liberal Senator Nick Minchin, the new Leader of the Government in the Senate, spoke in support of Humphries and his views, and ""was not persuaded to support [the] bill"", and expressed his ""conservative"" views that life begun ""from conception onwards"". Family First Party Senator Steven Fielding spoke out against the bill also, likening the TGA as comprising of ""unelected bureaucrats"". He further commented that Family First cannot consider the social policy issues without considering social views, and drew attention to the TGA's response in the earlier Senate inquiry that the TGA ""cannot consider social and ethical issues"". Fielding drew attention to the guillotine being placed on the debate of the bill and the attitudes of the non-Government senators earlier criticising the Government on the industrial relations legislation being ""rammed through"" late last year.
 Other senators, including Guy Barnett (Lib.), Helen Polley (Labor), also later spoke against the bill; Senators Judith Adams (Lib.), Ruth Webber (Labor) spoke in support.

 In Federal Parliament Leader of the House Tony Abbott moved to adjourn debate at 9.06pm, to which his Labor counterpart Julia Gillard attempted to adjourn the Telstra debate until today, but Abbott put the question and used the Government's majority to move debate onward. 
 Abbott then moved that the legislation, comprising of three bills, be considered as urgent and allotted approximately forty-five minutes to debate all three. The Opposition had attempted to further amend the urgency motion which failed due to Government majority — there were six divisions in the space of approximately half an hour, all which failed. Gillard and Dick Adams had called the process ""a disgrace"", and the amendments (negotiated earlier by Senator Barnaby Joyce) were termed the ""'Backdown Barnaby' bribe"" by Stephen Smith before the Deputy Speaker Ian Causley asked him to withdraw.
 Whilst the Government has an absolute majority in the Australian Senate, it is not guaranteed that the necessary legislation will pass this house. Garnering the support of key Senator Joyce is critical to ensure that the bills will pass (as he will have the deciding vote) and he has already stated that, due to a damning report released earlier in the House of Representatives showing that fourteen percent of lines were faulty amongst other criticism, that it has turned the ""green [light] to amber"" [1]. Joyce was crucial in defeating a Senate Opposition motion to delay debate until October 4, even though he himself agreed that the time for debate should be extended; he stated in an interview on the AM program on ABC Radio National that he voted against the motion as he believed crossing the floor would destroy any ""political capital"" he had to enable him to further negotiate improvements to the Telstra deal within his own party.

"," Treasury documents released today under the Freedom of Information (FOI) act reveal that Australians could face up to an A$863 rise  in household costs per annum if the government proceeds with its plans to put a tax on carbon emissions.
 The documents reveal an a annual price rise of $218.40 for electricity, $114.40 for gas, $187.20 for petrol and $88.40 for food for the average household. The treasury modelling was based on a $30 carbon tax, but also estimated other prices such as a $40 tax which predicted a rise of over $1,100 to the average household's annual budget. However, they do not take into account the compensation deals and offsets promised by the government if a price is put on carbon. 
 After viewing the treasury modelling, Treasurer Wayne Swan and Climate Change Minister Greg Combet released a joint statement saying without the finalization of compensation packages it is too early to predict price rises. ""No final decisions on the starting price or assistance have been taken and therefore it is far too early to speculate on any potential price impacts,"" the statement said. Until the final design and modelling have been settled, anyone who uses these figures to scare families about prices is engaging in a dishonest, misleading scare campaign.""
 Opposition Leader Tony Abbott said the figures demonstrated the toll a carbon tax would have on Australian families. This just demonstrates that the Government has known all along that its carbon tax won't clean up the environment but it will clean out your wallet,"" he said. That's right and this is $863 a year in extra burden that the Australian people shouldn't have to pay. This is an $863 a year hit on families' cost of living. Families are doing it tough as things stand. They don't need a bad situation made much, much worse by Julia Gillard's carbon tax.""

 Candidate Joel Anderson, a member of the California State Assembly, won the Republican Party primary for the California State Senate 36th District being vacated by termed-out politician Senate Minority Leader Dennis Hollingsworth, on Tuesday. With 100 percent of the election precincts reporting, Anderson won over 45 percent of the total votes cast in the Republican primary.
 However, The Valley News, a news publication based in Riverside, California, mistakenly reported that Anderson's opponent, Jeff Stone, had won the Republican primary. The Valley News later deleted its own article and reposted a new one with the correct information about the election results, without posting a correction.
 California political journalist Barry Jantz reported that the mistake was due to the publisher of The Valley News only having examined the election results for Riverside, and not the entire election district. The Republican primary won by Anderson encompasses an election district, which includes both Riverside County, and San Diego County.
 Jantz noted, ""A new story has now been posted, without a trace of the incorrect report or a correction."" He referred to the erroneous article subsequently deleted by the Valley Press as, ""the story that was...and wasn't...and now never existed"". The San Diego County publication, East County Magazine, commented on the incident, and characterized it as ""an error reminiscent of the infamous 'Dewey Defeats Truman' headline.""
 ""Dewey Defeats Truman"" was an erroneous front-page headline by the newspaper Chicago Tribune published November 3, 1948, a day before U.S. President Harry Truman won the 1948 presidential election against New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey.
 Anderson will be the Republican Party candidate in the November general election for California State Senate. His opponent will be Paul Clay, a Democrat and teacher based in Riverside County. The district primarily consists of registered Republicans.

The announcement was made by a spokesman for California's governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The cuts would begin at the start of the fiscal year on July 1.
 This comes after California lawmakers voted down a budget worth US$40 billion last weekend.
 ""In the absence of a budget, the governor has a responsibility to realise state savings any way he can,"" said Aaron McLear, Schwarzenegger's spokesman. ""This is unfortunately a necessary decision."" 
 The state is also planning to put all remaining public work projects on hold, which could cost thousands of construction workers their jobs.
 California has the world's eighth largest economy. It has suffered from unemployment and the housing crisis, with Schwarzenegger declaring a fiscal emergency last December.
 ""We are dealing with a catastrophe of unbelievable proportions,"" said Alan Lowenthal, a Democratic state senator from Long Beach.
 The budget plan consisted of $11.4 billion in borrowing, $14.4 billion for temporary increases in taxes, and $15.1 billion dedicated for program cuts. The package initially appeared to have enough support to reach the two-thirds majority needed to make the bill a law, but fell short by a single vote. The Assembly was at one point in session for thirty hours, breaking the record for the longest legislative session in the history of the state.
 Many Republican lawmakers say they disagree with the tax increases that are included as part of the budget package.

The bill for the budget, SB 129, and the bill for the stimulus payments, SB 139, both passed both houses of the California Legislature for this fiscial year.
 The payments, dubbed the Golden State Stimulus II, are set to be paid out to eligible California taxpaying residents beginning in September.  To be eligible, residents must have filed a state tax return for last year, not be someone's dependent, and must have earned no more than US$75 thousand in wages last year.
 Eligible Californians would get a one-time payment of US$600, and households with dependents would receive an additional US$500.  Around two-thirds of Californians are expected to get a stimulus payment, according to the governor's office.  Newsom initially proposed the payments in May to aid the state's economic recovery, as part of his ""California Comeback Plan"".
 Californians who already received a stimulus payment earlier in the year are not eligible for this second payment.  An additional payment of US$500 is still available for those who claimed dependents on their returns.
 The budget also provides for US$5.2 billion in renters' aid for low-income residents and landlords, which would pay for all rent left unpaid during the COVID-19 crisis, and cover rent for several coming months.  Overdue water and utility payments would also be covered by US$2 billion in funding.
 An additional US$1.5 billion was for grant money intended for small businesses, with US$120 million in tax credits for businesses willing to relocate to California.
 California had a budget surplus of nearly US$76 billion during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 In signing SB 129, Newsom line-item vetoed Section 19.55 of the bill concerning US$2.58 billion in appropriations to various funds ""on a technical basis"", citing in an explanation appropriations covered under the section were superseded by the budget.  In California, a governor may approve a bill passed by the Legislature with specific items related to the budget rejected.  The Legislature can override this line-item veto with a two-thirds vote of both the Assembly and the Senate.

"," A measure to ban the use of lead bullets in California was moved forward by the State's Senate yesterday. Assembly Bill 821 bans the use of lead bullets for hunting within California. The bill, which was sponsored by Assemblyman Pete Nava and has letters of support from a number of conservation and environmental groups, was passed by a majority of 23 to 15.
 Bill proponents argued that an important reason to support the ban rests in the threat lead bullets pose to endangered species such as the California condor.
 ""I am elated that the fight to save the condor, North America’s largest bird, is one step closer to reality,"" stated Nava.  
 ""The California Condor is a national treasure and with the recent death of a California condor at the Los Angeles Zoo last week from lead poisoning, further highlights the urgent need for my legislation so that our children and grandchildren can know and see these magnificent birds in the wild,"" added Nava.
 Bill opponents, primarily groups that support hunting and the right to bear arms, argued that lead bullets were not a significant source of the threat to California condors. A statement posted on the web site of the National Rifle Association states, ""the most recent scientific review provided to the Commission revealed that previous science attempting to show a link between lead ammunition and condor mortality is severely flawed.""
 Scientists at the Zoological Society of San Diego, an organization that has worked to reproduce condors and place them back in the wild since the 1980's state that there is strong evidence to support the effect of lead bullets on California condor populations. 
 ""All of the California condors which die in the wild are brought to us to determine the cause of death,"" stated Allison Alberts, Director of Conservation and Research for the Zoological Society of San Diego. 
 ""Of these condors, 24% have died of lead poisoning. Studies indicate that this lead is coming from bullet fragments and shot that have been ingested when eating carcasses,"" added Alberts.
 An article published by Bird Conservation International cites the ingestion of trash picked up from the environment as another serious threat to condor populations. This study indicates the threat is primarily for juvenile condors in the nest however.

Soft drinks are already banned during school hours. ""Sugar-sweetened electrolyte replacement beverages are still available and have surged in popularity among kids,"" said Senator Alex Padilla. ""This is a common sense step forward in the effort to address the obesity epidemic in California,"" he added. Padilla's bill is now on its way to the Assembly.
 Studies have shown that drinks, especially sweetened, contribute to obesity among adults and children, leading to diseases like diabetes.

"," The California State Senate voted on Thursday to allow homosexuals to marry, therefore becoming the first legislative body in the United States to embrace the controversial issue.
 The Senate approved the Religious Freedom and Civil Marriage Protection Act, which would define marriage as a civil contract between two people rather than a man and a woman. The vote passed by the minimum number of necessary votes, 21-15. All Republicans in the Senate opposed the bill, as did one Democrat, Sen. Dean Florez of Shafter. Three Democrats abstained.
 The bill's chief sponsor, Assemblyman Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) said, ""We're looking for three votes, and I can't tell you today who the three will be, but I think the power of the success coming from the floor of the Senate today will give us the necessary momentum and encouragement to do what we all know is the right thing to do.""
 California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's spokeswoman, Margita Thompson, stated that the Governor believes the issue should be decided by the court and not the legislature.
 ""The governor was elected to uphold the laws of California. The people spoke when they voted in Proposition 22. It has subsequently gone to the courts and the governor believes that is where it should be decided. It's an issue for the people and the courts,"" she said.  Prop 22, which is currently being challenged by San Francisco, deals only with the issue of non-Californian marriages.
 Because California has a direct democracy, decisions of the legislature can be overturned by a direct vote of the people.  A court decision on the matter, however, could not be overturned except by a higher court.

"," On Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 1084 (AB-1084), which requires retailers with 500 or more employees throughout the state to keep a gender-neutral area for childcare products and toys. The law is set to take effect in 2024.
 The bill says that ""a retail department store that offers childcare items or toys for sale shall maintain a gender neutral section or area, to be labeled at the discretion of the retailer, in which a reasonable selection of the items and toys for children that it sells shall be displayed, regardless of whether they have been traditionally marketed for either girls or for boys."" Boy and girl sections are not prohibited, but a common section alongside them is required. While the original version included clothing, during California Senate proceedings that part was removed from the text.
 Non-compliance calls for a US$250 civil penalty for a first case, and US$500 for subsequent violations. Courts could order the violator to pay court costs and attorney's fees. 
 Assembly members Evan Low and Cristina Garcia, both members of the Democratic Party, introduced the bill into the California Assembly, the lower house of the state's legislature. AB-1084 was amended by both houses, then passed the Assembly in a 49-16 vote on September 2 before being sent to the governor's desk for approval.
 Speaking about the bill, Low said, ""Part of it is to make sure if you're a young girl that you can find a police car, fire truck, a periodic table or a dinosaur. And then similarly, if you're a boy, if you're more artistic and want to play with glitter, why not? Why should you feel the stigma of saying, 'Oh, this should be shamed', and going to a different location?""
 On July 25, Garcia noted in a Facebook post, ""As a math teacher I saw 1st hand how playtime creates the building blocks for attaining spatial awareness that’s important for studying geometry, unfortunately these toys are often labeled as boy toys. Removing the gender identity from these toys will hopefully lead to more boys & girls entering STEM fields.""
 The bill was opposed by members of the Republican Party: Republican state Senator Melissa Melendez said, ""I don't think parents need the government to step in and tell them how they should shop for their children"". In opposition of the bill, the Capitol Resource Institute argued that ""it is not the business of the government to instruct retail stores how they should display and market their merchandise."" 
 On April 6, during a public hearing before the Business and Professions Committee of the Assembly, Greg Burt of the California Family Council called AB-1084 ""impossible to comply with"" as it does not define the intended meaning of ""reasonable amount"" and ""a bill like this opens the door to a never-ending number of complaints from activist groups who don’t like the way stores are marketing their products to one sex or another"".
 Assembly Bill 2826, introduced to the Assembly by Low in 2020, which targeted a similar goal, died in the Legislature.
 Retail corporation Target, with 1915 stores in the United States, dropped traditional toy section labeling in 2015. ""In fact it would be more difficult to find a large retailer today that segregates toys by gender"", noted the Southwest California Legislative Council, an opponent of the bill.

"," Women's rights advocate and Georgetown University Law Center graduate Sandra Fluke announced her candidacy yesterday to run for the California State Senate.
 The Democrat previously stated she would run for a seat in the United States Congress being vacated by retiring Congressman Henry Waxman. She informed the Los Angeles Times that she decided to run for the California State Senate instead of the U.S. Congress because she felt she would be able to accomplish more for the people of California as a state Senator.
 She will attempt to gain election to the seat currently occupied by Ted Lieu, a Democrat from Torrance, California. Lieu is currently in the beginning of his own campaign for Congressman Waxman's seat representing California's 33rd congressional district.
 In a release to the press, Fluke said: ""I am extremely moved by the outpouring of local and national support I have received since I announced that I was considering running for office. My entire career has been devoted to the public interest, whether representing victims of human trafficking or advocating for working families.""
 She described her intentions for the California legislature: ""I am committed to continuing that fight in Sacramento, working to protect our environment, ensure our access to health care, and create the jobs that are desperately needed. While I strongly considered offering my candidacy for Congress, I feel there is a better way for me to advance the causes that are important to our community.""
 Fluke characterized herself as a new voice for progressivism: ""I believe that the families and communities of this district — from West Hollywood to West L.A. and from Santa Monica to Torrance and beyond — deserve to have a fresh perspective from a new generation of progressive leadership in Sacramento, and I am eager to get to work fighting for the causes that matter most to our future as a community, state and nation.""
 After graduating from law school, Fluke moved to Los Angeles where she used her skills as a lawyer to help improve conditions for individuals related to improving the living wage and advocating for better foster care for children.
 Fluke was nominated as a candidate by Time magazine for their Person of the Year of 2012. Time concluded Fluke helped give U.S. President Barack Obama an edge in his 2012 presidential re-election campaign.
 Fluke was a featured speaker on September 5, 2012 at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. Fluke spoke to attendees at the convention about the consequences for women of electing Republican candidate for U.S. President Mitt Romney over incumbent President Barack Obama. Fluke campaigned with President Obama in his bid for re-election.
 She was recognized April 22, 2012 with the Stand Up for Choice Award. Fluke was given the Stand Up for Choice Award at the ""Third Annual Multi-Generational Brunch"" of the organization NARAL Pro-Choice America which was held in New York City (NYC), New York in the United States. 
 Fluke received a nomination in March 2012 as a candidate for Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. The list is released annually as a special edition of Time magazine, titled Time 100.

"," California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a bipartisan state budget Friday that invests a record $55.1 billion in education - an increase of $3.1 billion this year and $8.3 billion over the last two years - and allocates $4.9 billion to create a  budget reserve and to pay down the state's debt early.
 Schwarzenegger credited bipartisan cooperation in coming up with a budget he was willing to sign, and do it on time, a rarity in recent California politics.
 ""It's amazing what can be accomplished when Democrats and Republicans work together in Sacramento,"" said Schwarzenegger. ""I want to thank the legislative leadership - Senators Don Perata and Dick Ackerman, Speaker Fabian Nunez and Assembly Republican Leader George Plescia - for all their hard work on the budget. We put politics aside and were driven by the overwhelming desire to do what's best for the people of California. 
 ""I am especially proud that the budget expands preschool, and returns art, music and physical education classes to our children,"" he said.
 State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell said he is pleased by the budget. ""The budget passed by the Legislature brings welcome support to education in California, making good on past debts to our schools and investing in sorely needed classroom programs,"" he said.
 He had his own budget favorites: ""I’m particularly pleased that the budget includes increased funding for school counselors, teacher professional development, programs targeted to helping students pass the high school exit exam, and expanded and improved student nutrition programs.
 ""While there are some priorities over which we may disagree, I applaud the Governor and the Legislature for a budget that makes education a top priority.""
 Barbara E. Kerr, president of the 335,000-member California Teachers Association, also likes the direction of the new budget.
“The timely approval of the new state budget is good news for our public schools and students,"" she said. ""School districts and teachers can now plan ahead. The nearly six percent cost-of-living-adjustment will allow local schools to restore funding to education programs that have been cut over the past few years and provide for salary increases.""
 Still, Kerr, said, the budget doesn't go far enough. “This budget is a down payment on the debt owed to our schools. Teachers will continue to work with the governor and the Legislature to ensure repayment of the $3 billion still owed to our schools under Proposition 98 and the lawsuit settlement agreement announced last month. That money will help our schools of greatest need reduce class sizes, improve teacher training and increase parental involvement.""
 How the budget affects the New Haven Unified School District and James Logan High School, or the James Logan Courier, specifically is not yet clear.
 State Treasurer Phil Angelides, who is running for governor against Schwarzenegger,  liked  the increased education funding, and praised his fellow Democrats in the legislature for that, but criticized the entire budget for being out of balance.
 “On higher education, Democrats in the Legislature did the right thing, when the governor would not, and gained a $6 per unit rollback in community college fees,"" he said in a statement. ""That is a start. But the governor’s budget will still leave community college fees nearly double what they were just three years ago. And the budget will also leave untouched the fees at CSU and UC, which have increased by $2,000 and $5,000 respectively under Governor Schwarzenegger.""
 Missing from the budget, Angelides said, is funding to expand health care for low-income children.  Schwarzenegger ""failed to get members of his own party to agree to a budget that funds health care for more kids from low-income families on the Healthy Families program regardless of the families’ immigration status. Compassion requires – and intelligent public health practice demands – that all people residing in California have access to adequate health care,” Angelides said.
 Schwarzenegger credited a strong economy that increased state revenues for providing the cash to cover the increased expenditures and set aside a $2.1 billion reserve and an additional $2.8 billion for debt prepayment. Included in that is $1.42 billion for repaying borrowed funds earmarked by the voters for transportation projects aimed at reducing traffic throughout the state. The early debt payment and the reserve account for nearly 4.7 percent of the overall budget - the highest in 25 years.
 Still, Angelides said, the budget is out of balance and the state is running up more debt. “Despite his repeated pledges to ‘cut up the credit card’ Governor Schwarzenegger has produced a budget that still leaves a $3.3 billion structural budget deficit for 2006-07 and more deficits for years to come,"" Angelides said, ""It is a budget that
will continue to shift the burden of today’s deficits onto the backs of future
generations.""
 The budget  largely mirrors the May Revise, which has since prompted all three Wall Street credit rating agencies to upgrade the state credit rating, reducing the cost of state borrowing. One of the agencies, Fitch, Inc.,  cited ""California's continuing economic recovery, strong revenue performance and continued progress in reducing fiscal imbalance"" when upgrading their rating on the state's general obligation debt from A to A+ last month.  Standard and Poor's also raised its rating from A to A+ in May.  Moody's Investors Service raised its rating from A2 to A1 the same month.
 Despite the improved credit ratings, Angelides said, the three rating agencies still have reservations about the state's fiscal future.  The agencies ""have corroborated my warning and that of the Legislative Analyst that while state revenues have improved, California’s fiscal condition will remain insecure until the state produces balanced budgets,"" he said.
 Highlights of AB 1801, the Budget Act of 2006 by Assembly member John Laird (D-Santa Cruz), include:
 Preschool through High School Education - The budget includes $100 million for the Governor's targeted preschool initiative, which will make preschool available to every four year old living in a low-performing school district. $50 million of this funding will be used to build and improve preschool facilities. The budget also includes $645 million to fund physical education, arts and music programs. Overall, $11,264 will be spent on each student, an increase of $516 from the current year.
 Higher Education - The budget allocates $19.1 billion from all sources for higher education and eliminates tuition and fee increases at UC and CSU. California, which already has the lowest community college fees in the nation, will further lower student fees from $26 per unit to $20, effective Spring 2007.
 Law Enforcement  - The budget includes an additional $196 million to support law enforcement efforts, including money to fund Sexual Assault Felony Enforcement teams, 500 GPS devices to track and monitor the highest-risk parolees and four new Gang Suppression Enforcement Teams. The budget also proposes the addition of 235 California Highway Patrol positions, includes $56.4 million to replace the CHP's existing radio system and allocates $6.4 million to handle the increasing number of wireless 9-1-1 calls. Additionally, the budget includes a $20 million investment to strengthen efforts to fight methamphetamine trafficking and $6 million to create three new California Methamphetamine Strategy program teams.
 Disaster Preparedness - The budget provides $220 million to enhance California's ability to prepare for, mitigate and respond to emergencies, including money to strengthen public health response during a disaster. This includes preparations to prevent a pandemic influenza outbreak and expanding efforts to help local governments develop disaster preparedness plans.
 Public Health - The budget includes $22.6 million for counties to perform outreach and enrollment activities to reach the 428,000 children who are eligible for Medi-Cal or the Healthy Families program but are not enrolled. The budget for the Healthy Families program also covers enrollment growth for 78,200 additional children.
 Transportation - In addition, the Budget makes a substantial investment in improving California's transportation system. It provides $1.4 billion to fully fund Proposition 42 for the second consecutive year, and it provides an additional $1.4 billion for the early repayment of past loans from Proposition 42, for a total of $2.8 billion. Of the $1.4 billion repayment, $440 million is designated for cities and counties for local road and street maintenance that would otherwise not be funded.
 The budget is the first on time budget since 2000 and the fourth in the last 20 years. The 2006-07 budget's general fund is $101.3 billion and total is $131.4 billion. For a more detailed overview of the budget, please visit www.dof.ca.gov.

"," Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney testified Thursday before an ethics committee in the Canadian House of Commons about the Airbus affair, a case involving alleged bribery at the highest levels of government to secure Airbus sales of aircraft to Air Canada.
 In his testimony, Mulroney said that he should not have associated with German businessman Karlheinz Schreiber nor should have he accepted bundles of cash — which he placed in safe deposit boxes in two different countries.
 Nonetheless, Mulroney denied accepting kickbacks. He admitted taking about CAD225,000 in cash from Schreiber in 1993 and 1994, which was after his departure from politics. He also said that the money involved promoting Schreiber's private business dealings.
 To the committee Muroney said: ""When I look back on it today, I realize I made a serious error of judgment in receiving a payment in cash for this assignment even though it was decidedly not illegal to do so. That mistake in judgment was mine alone. I apologize and I accept full responsibility for it. ... I should have declined the offer. I should have insisted that payment be in a more transparent or more accountable manner. By not doing so I inadvertently created an impression of impropriety on the high office I was privileged to hold.""
 ""Do you realize, Mr. Mulroney, that the way in which you acted in this matter did not make it appear that it were a legitimate transaction,"" said MP Serge Ménard of Bloc Québécois.
 Two days earlier, Schreiber testified before the same committee, alleging that Mulroney agreed to accept CAD300,000 to promote a light armored vehicle factory and benefited from the purchase of 34 Airbus aircraft by Air Canada.
 ""I never received a cent from anyone for services rendered to anyone in connection with the purchase by Air Canada from Airbus of 34 aircraft,"" Mulroney said, refuting Schreiber.
 Mulroney also attacked Schreiber's credibility, pointing out that the German could be extradited to his home country where he faces charges. ""He succeeded. He got what he wanted ... he’s sitting in his mansion over in Rockcliffe,"" Mulroney said. ""I think he seriously misled every member of this House ... with this false affidavit.""
 The committee's investigation will resume in late January, when it is expected to call dozens of witnesses.

"," In a 158 to 133 vote of the House of Commons held Tuesday night, Canadian MPs have approved the legalization of same-sex weddings in Canada.  Assuming the Senate passes Bill C-38 and the Governor General gives royal assent, Canada will become the fourth country in the world to legalize same-sex weddings after the Netherlands, Belgium, and Spain.  The bill presented to the House of Commons by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Paul Martin has passed mainly because of support by the left-wing New Democratic Party of Jack Layton and the support of the separatist Bloc Québécois, which enabled it to overcome the staunch opposition of the Conservative Party.
 While this vote is historic, gay weddings had already been legalized by the Supreme Courts of most Canadian provinces.  The C-38 bill now extends these rulings to the rest of Canada, namely to the provinces of Alberta, Prince Edward Island, and the territory of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.
 The adoption of this bill ends a longstanding political and judicial debate in Canada, with the House of Commons referring the issue to the Supreme Court of Canada last year, only to have it handed back to them by the judges. If the debate has just been closed in a political sense, gay rights continue to create tensions between Canadians, since support for gay weddings comes mainly from Quebec and Ontario and parts of British Columbia while the Maritimes and Prairie provinces are mostly against them.
 Those tensions have also been felt in the House of Commons itself, when Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper said on Monday, anticipating that the C-38 bill would be adopted, that the vote would ""lack in legitimacy"" since the bill would pass because of an unnatural alliance between the federalist Liberals and the separatist Bloc Québécois.  This partisan view of gay rights has been strongly condemned, especially by Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe who said that MPs from his party were democratically elected and as legitimate as any in parliament.  Others called Harper a hypocrite, pouncing on the fact that he never raised any such objections allying with the Bloc in the previous month's confidence votes.  Prior to the vote, Joe Comuzzi announced his resignation from the Liberal cabinet because of his opposition to gay weddings and the fact that Liberal cabinet members were required to vote the party line in this case.

Several Conservative MPs abstained from the vote including Michael Chong who resigned earlier in the day as Intergovernmental Affairs minister due to his opposition to the motion. While the dissenting Liberal MPs do not face censure by their party, Conservative backbenchers who opposed the resolution could only go as far as abstaining if they wished to remain in the Tory caucus, according to Mr. Chong. 
 The surprise motion was introduced by Prime Minister Stephen Harper on November 22 in response to a motion by the separatist Bloc Québécois that the House recognize Quebec as a nation. The government resolution substituted the word Québécois for Quebeckers and added the words ""within a united Canada"". The motion reads: ""That this House recognize that the Québécois form a nation within a united Canada.""
 The government has stated that they have no intention to amend the Constitution of Canada to recognize Quebec's national status although several political analysts have argued that such an attempt is now inevitable.

 Senators would campaign like any other politician. Voters in their province that has a Senate vacancy would cast ballots for their favorite candidate at the same time as a vote in a general election.
 The only provinces that actually has had Senate elections are Alberta and British Columbia. In 1989, then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney appointed Stan Waters to the Senate after he was elected in an Alberta-wide vote to fill a vacancy in the upper house. 
 Alberta Premier designate Ed Stelmach says he agrees with Harper's proposal.
 ""I believe what Prime Minister Harper is doing is opening up consultation in terms of how to bring about Senate reform and we're going to work with him,"" said Stelmach in Edmonton, the capital of Alberta. ""We have been supportive of Senate reform for many, many years and will continue to do so. I'm awaiting the details of his proposals.""
 Harper has already introduced a bill which will attempt to limit the terms of senators to eight years. The 105-member Senate is currently dominated by the Liberals.
 ""Many Albertans I'm sure will share my view that it will not be good for the province to have an elected Senate as long as we don't have a constitutional change on the number of senators by province,"" Liberal leader Stephane Dion said.
 If the bill fails, Harper is expected to campaign on the issue in the next federal election, which is expected next year.

 Stephen Harper will be meeting with the Dalai Lama XIV, 72, on Monday at the Prime Minister's Office in Ottawa at 2 p.m.
 The Dalai Lama is scheduled to give a speech the day before in Ottawa in a downtown arena. He will meet with secretary of state for multiculturalism, Jason Kenney, in Gatineau, Quebec on Monday, then hold a news conference, later meet the prime minister, and meet at a reception with all the parliamentarians. Governors General Michaëlle Jean will meet with him at her Rideau Hall residence, followed by a meet with Liberal MPs at a hotel on Tuesday.
 This is the second time the Dalai Lama will meet with a Canadian Prime Minister. Former Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Mackay and the PM made a controversial move and appointed the Dalai Lama honorary Canadian citizenship in June 2006. Jason Kenney, who visited the house of former Communist party chief Zhao Ziyang in China, and accidentally went to a rally supporting the People's Mujahedin of Iran, was instrumental in granting him honorary citizenship. Paul Martin later criticised him for visiting the home. Kenney is a member of the Canada-Tibet Committee.
 Former Liberal Canadian PM Paul Martin met with the Dalai Lama at a Roman Catholic archbishop's house, showing he respected the figure but there were some wide religious differences. Harper is also a Catholic.
 Two weeks before, U.S. President George W. Bush met with the famous religious figure, which sparkled up controversy from the Chinese government. He is the first sitting U.S. president to appear with the Dalai Lama in public.
 ""I think what some of these countries are now seeing is that the changes that were promised in China have not happened at a fast enough rate, and that the Dalai Lama's travels are an opportunity for those countries to continue the exertion on China for democratic reform and better protection of human rights,"" said executive director of the Canada-Tibet Committee, Dermod Travis.
 ""China is not looking very good in all this. They're coming across as bullies. China can send out these press releases, but I don't believe they'll stop doing business with all these countries,"" said Consiglio Di Nino, a Canadian senator, who is co-chairman of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet, and was instrumental in organising the visit.
 ""Whoever this young man was he had taken a tremendous risk. He was just like many others trying to send a message out to the world,"" said Nino, recalling in the 1990's a young boy from a monastery who left a sad help note in his hand. Nino gave him a picture of the Dalai Lama to reassure him. ""It's got to be one of the most wonderful moments of my life, the incredible unspoken message between us.""

"," The House of Commons approved a state funeral for the last standing World War I veteran Tuesday. Three of them are still alive, Percy Wilson, who is 105 years old, Lloyd Clemett and John Babcock, both 106. They are the last three living veterans among the 619,636 Canadians who served between 1914 and 1918.
 The motion, introduced by the New Democratic Party, was favored by all party leaders. The motion was prompted by an online petition by the Dominion Institute, a national organization which promotes Canadian history.
 State funerals in Canada, by tradition, are reserved for prime ministers and governors general. This bill, which is now in affect in Canada, means that state funerals are not only for prime ministers but for people who have served the country.
 ""We want to thank the tens of thousands of Canadians who signed our petition in support of state funeral,"" said Rudyard Griffiths, the director of the Dominion Institute. ""By passing a motion to offer a full state funeral today the Parliament of Canada will allow a grateful nation to pay proper tribute to our last Great War veteran on his passing and honour the over 600,000 Canadians he served with under arms from 1914-1918.""
 Australia, also held a state funeral for the final veteran of the Battle of Gallipoli. A State Funeral was offered for Steve Irwin in September 2006, but the offer was declined by his family's wishes. Canada is the fourth country to have a funeral honoring the last war veteran that served in any war.
 ""We won't be able to look them in the eyes anymore and thank them for their service the way we should for everyone who is willing to serve our country the way they did and our armed forces personnel still do,"" NDP Leader Jack Layton said.
 Since November 6, around 100,000 Canadians had signed the online petition.

"," On Monday, Canada, the European Union (EU), the United Kingdom and the United States imposed new sanctions on senior officials and entities in Belarus over the May 23 diversion of a Ryanair flight and subsequent arrest of dissident journalist Roman Protasevich and his girlfriend Sofia Sapega, as well as ""repressive practices"" committed by the Belarusian government.
 The joint action was aimed at putting pressure on Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko's ""regime"", a joint statement read, citing ""continued attacks on human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law"", as well as the ""politically motivated"" arrest of Mr Protasevich and Ms Sapega.
 The statement went on to express support for ""the long-suppressed democratic aspirations of the people of Belarus"", calling for Belarusian co-operation in investigations into the incident, the release of all political prisoners, adherence to the recommendations of an expert mission by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), of which Belarus is a participating state, and OSCE-facilitated dialogue between the government and opposition.
 The circumstances surrounding the forced landing of Ryanair flight FR4978 from Lithuania to Greece in Minsk, the Belarusian capital, are contested.  As reported by Sky News, state media says the diversion was due to threat of explosives on board, a claim Global Affairs Canada calls ""dubious and still unverified"".
 Total restrictive measures varied between the countries and regional organisation.  Canada sanctioned 17 new individuals for a total of 72, and five entities described in a press release as being ""due to the ongoing disregard for human rights demonstrated"".
 The EU, through the Council of the European Union, extended its restrictive measures by 78 individuals and eight entities related either to human rights violations or the ""forced and unlawful landing"", to a total of 166 individuals and fifteen entities.  Those who are impacted, including judges, businesspeople, university rectors and government ministers, will be subject to an asset freeze, and persons affected prohibited to enter or transit through EU territory.
 The measures also prohibit EU citizens and companies from making money available to the designated.  According to the Associated Press, EU policy chief Josep Borrell said the measures ""are going to hurt [...] the economy of Belarus heavily"".  The decision to affect entities, not just individuals, foreign minister of Germany Heiko Maas said, will impact the ""economic areas that are of particular significance for Belarus and for the regime’s income""; those targeted include the export of fertiliser ingredient potash, and those of tobacco and petroleum.
 The United Kingdom furthered sanctions levied with Canada in September on eight Belarusian officials, including Lukashenko, his son, and senior government members.  New restrictions include eleven individuals and two entities, which are henceforth subject to asset freezes and travel bans.
 Among those targeted includes petroleum exporter BNK (UK) Ltd, which, according to its 2019 report of the director presented to Companies House, ""provides intermediate services to oil sector companies"" in Belarus.  According to a government press release, UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said ""cutting off oil export revenue streams"" was one way the government would ""hold the [Belarusian] regime to account"".
 The United States, through the State Department and Office of Foreign Assets Control under the Treasury Department, imposed visa restrictions on 46 Belarusian individuals holding ""key positions"" in the country, according to a press release, and added 16 individuals and five entities to a designated list.  In addition to concerns of the country's ""transnational repression"" and ""affronts to international efforts"", the US also cited the ""fraudulent"" 2020 Belarusian presidential election as cause for the sanctions' imposition.
 The timing of the sanctions was questioned by Belarusian Nikolai Shchekin on state media network the Belarusian Telegraph Agency, noting the date June 21 is one day before the anniversary of the start of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, or the ""Great Patriotic War"".  According to CNN, the US attempted to announce its sanctions earlier, prior to a meeting between US president Joe Biden and president of Russia Vladimir Putin, but was held up by the EU.

"," The Council of the European Union voted yesterday to extend the term of copyright on sound recordings by twenty years, from 50 years to 70, preventing a number of early recordings of 1960s rock musicians including The Beatles from entering the public domain. The 1962 hit ""Love Me Do"" would have entered the public domain in 2012 if this legislation had not been introduced. EU member states have to enact the copyright extension within two years.
 The news was welcomed by representatives of the recording industry and by some recording artists. Cliff Richard has campaigned for term extension. Mick Jagger from the Rolling Stones said the decision was ""obviously advantageous"" to performers, and Bjorn Ulvaeus from Abba welcomed the continued control over the group's recordings: ""Now I won't have to see Abba being used in a TV commercial"". Geoff Taylor from the British Phonographic Industry said ""[a]n exceptional period of British musical genius was about to lose its protection. As a matter of principle, it is right that our musicians should benefit from their creativity during their lifetimes, and that they should not be disadvantaged compared to musicians in other countries.""
 Extension of the copyright term also has critics. Jim Killock, from the British digital rights advocacy group the Open Rights Group (ORG), said the move ""puts money into the pockets of big labels"" but will be ""unlikely to benefit smaller artists and it will mean that a lot of sound recordings that are out of print will stay out of print"". Singer Sandie Shaw, of the Featured Artists' Coalition, said the move would be ""extremely good news for record companies and collection agencies, but bad news for artists"" and would lead to artists having ""20 more years in servitude to contracts that are no longer appropriate to a digital age"".
 The extension to 70 years is less than that EU Commissioner Charlie McCreevy proposed in 2008. At that time, Wikinews interviewed Eddan Katz of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Becky Hogge, then Executive Director of ORG, in Brussels. The two organisations were gathering like-minded groups to oppose harmonisation with the US's 95-year term. Characterising the sought extension as ""Cliff Richard's pension"", Hogge asserted, ""[w]hat you've got at the end of the day with copyright term extension is basically [...] rent seeking by special interest groups lobbying governments to change the law in order that they may economically gain directly.""
 Two reviews of intellectual property rights in Britain have concluded it would not be economically beneficial to extend copyright terms on sound recordings. The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property in 2006 concluded extension of the copyright term would ""negatively impact upon consumers and industry"". The Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property and Growth in 2011 concluded it would be ""economically detrimental"". A study conducted by Bournemouth University's Center for Intellectual Property Policy and Management concluded 72% of the economic benefits of the term extension would go to record labels, with 28% going to artists, only 4% of which are going to less successful artists.

"," The European Union's highest justice official has warned EU member states that any nations found to have hosted a covert CIA jail could have its ""voting rights suspended"". EU Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini said the consequences would be ""extremely serious"" if reports of such jails turned out to be true. 
 According to Human Rights Watch, the secret prisons are located in Poland and Romania. This comes amid an EU investigation into claims that the US ran clandestine jails in eastern Europe. In the case of Romania, a senior Euro MP has questioned whether its accession to the EU should go ahead as planned. The US has declined to confirm or deny the reports of secret jails, which became public in the US earlier this month.  
 Speaking at a news conference in Berlin, Mr Frattini called for tough penalties against any involved state, saying ""I would be obliged to propose to the Council of EU Ministers serious consequences, including the suspension of voting rights in the council.""  He said a suspension of voting rights would be justified if any country is found to have breached the bloc's founding principles of human rights, democracy and the rule of law. Such a move would be unprecedented for the EU.
 However, a diplomatic source said that to suspend a member state's voting rights in the Council of the European Union, the other 24 member states would have to vote unanimously to take such a step, which would be unlikely to happen in practice. 
 Mr Frattini said the Bush administration had asked for more time to deliver a response to the accusations after a senior commission official formally raised the issue on a visit to Washington last week.  ""Right now, there is no [US] response,"" he said.  The allegations that the CIA held al-Qaeda suspects in secret prisons in Eastern Europe were first reported in the Washington Post on November 2, but the newspaper withheld information on the location of the prisons on the request of the U.S. government.
 During his first U.S. visit, the newly appointed German foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier failed to receive any clarification on the question of secret CIA prisons, but the United States has now officially recognized that this is an issue of great concern to its European allies. Seceretary of State Condoleezza Rice promised an official U.S. clarification on this matter in the near future.

 The European Parliament has rejected the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions (software patent directive) sustained by lobbies of large software publicists such as the corporations Microsoft, Siemens, Nokia and Alcatel, grouped under the title of the European Information & Communications Technology Industry Association (EICTA, [1]). The directive involved the granting of software patents.
 648 MEPs out of 680 rejected the text, 18 voted for and 14 abstained.
 A rejection vote became the expected outcome when the European People's Party, initially in favour of the directive, decided to reject it.
 The European Greens, Socialist Group and European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party also voted for rejection of the directive for heterogeneous reason. Michel Rocard, author of a number of amendments to the original directive, said that the majority of the modifications were unlikely to be supported by the Commission and Council, with whom the Parliament would have had to enter a Conciliation procedure if it had voted for maintaining the directive in moditifed form. ""Better have no text at all than a bad one"", he added.
 Before the vote, Rocard pointed at the irritation of the Parliament towards the Commission: ""There is collective anger throughout the Parliament because of the way the directive was handled by the Commission and the Council"".
 During the debate on Tuesday, Commissioner Joaquín Almunia told MEPs: ""Should you decide to reject the common position, the Commission will not submit a new proposal."".
 The rejection was welcomed by small and medium software companies, as well as by Free Software supporters. The Directive had been subject to an intense campaigning, within the Parliament, in the news media and on the Internet.  The supporters of the Council position appear to have spent several ten millions, hiring prestigious PR agencies with at least 30-40 lobbyists who roamed the halls of the Parliament every day for 3 months, and many full-page advertisements in EU newspapers such as European Voice, EU Reporter etc.  The opponents of software patentability (that is supporters of the position taken by the European Parliament in its 1st reading of 24 September 2003), coordinated under the roof of the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII), also had several lobbyists stationed in Brussels, conducted several conferences and demonstrations and published some newspaper advertisements, with a total budget of nearly 100,000 eur apart from countless unpaid working hours of a dedicated supporter base, consisting mainly of programmers and software entrepreneurs.

Poland's Minister of Science and Computerisation, Wlodzimierz Marcinski. 
 The directive's opponents, some of whom had conceded defeat on Tuesday before the vote was taken, will continue the debate informally until meetings resume in 2005. 
 Software developers, who supported the European Parliament's proposal last year to definitively rule out software patents, welcomed the delay as a chance to reintroduce those provisions into the current draft.
 Florian Mueller, campaign manager of NoSoftwarePatents.com, which is supported by three IT companies (1&1, Red Hat, and MySQL AB), applauded Poland's move.
 ""The Polish government deserves greatest admiration for its courage!"" said Mueller in a press release. ""Now Europe has the opportunity to have a constructive debate on the severe shortcomings of the current Council text, under the new Luxembourgish EU presidency next year."" 
 Germany's representative also backed the delay, saying it would allow everyone to align the current proposal to changes proposed by the European Parliament last year. 
 ""We were well aware that [the current proposal] has room for improvement with an eye to the objective of arriving at a consensus position between the EU Council and the European Parliament,"" Germany's Federal Minister of Justice Brigitte Zypries said in a Tuesday statement. ""We will continue to work constructively toward finding a solution that even better meets the needs of those concerned than the decision taken in May of this year.""
 On May 18, 2004 EU Council reached a political agreement on a ""Common Position"" on the directive which ignored the European Parliament's vote from last year. The Council vote generated a lot of controversy. Later, the Dutch parliament failed to convince its EU representatives to reverse their vote. 
 According to the new voting weights which took effect on November 1, the majority needed to formally adopt the Common Position (after translations were done) is questionable. The 20 countries that supported the Directive on May 18 fall short of the new qualified majority by 16 votes.

"," Roughly 300 protesters turned up yesterday for the return of Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, to Edinburgh after last year's disastrous attempt at a press conference in a pub at the foot of The Canongate. Unseen by protesters or public, Farage is believed to have left the venue around 7:30pm.
 Farage's last visit saw protesters leaving him barracked in the bar by police, with several taxis refusing to take the party leader and Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for South East England to the airport.
 Given the hostile reception on his last visit, far-right group Britain First garnered publicity earlier in the week with an apparent offer of ""armoured vehicles"" for Farage's visit. However, no support from ex-BNP councillor Paul Golding's political party, or the offered armoured vehicles, were in-evidence.
 Despite attempts to keep the location secret, the Radical Independence Campaign began calling for protesters to turn up on Friday, at the city's Corn Exchange, nearly a week before the event. Farage was already believed to be inside the building when Wikinews arrived shortly after 4:30pm. At that time, five satellite trucks were present and New Market Road, running past the venue, was still open to traffic.
 Protesters began arriving en-masse closer to 5:30pm, with numbers peaking around an hour later. Police vans were moved to block the road; although, traffic to the venue was still being permitted for a wedding party with the misfortune to pick the same date as Farage's only visit to Scotland during the current European Parliament election campaign.
 Several speakers addressed the crowd protesting against UKIP being in Scotland, with the actual number of UKIP attendees inside, to hear Farage speak, estimated at around 50. One speaker, a schoolteacher, challenged the mainstream media's acceptance of UKIP's assertion the party is not racist, stating her primary school pupils were more-capable of identifying racism and would be pointing its presence out within UKIP were they present.
 Although loud, the protest passed peacefully. Chants directed at UKIP included ""Whose streets? Our streets! Whose city? Our city!"", ""Say it loud, say it clear: Refugees are welcome here!"" Other taunts called UKIP ""scum"", urged people to ""smash the SDL"" (Scottish Defence League), and clearly labelled UKIP and its supporters as racist.

"," The proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) was defeated in a plenary session of the European Parliament with 478 votes against versus 39 supporting; 165 parliamentarians chose to abstain.
 Pressure and activist groups across Europe celebrated the defeat of the legislation, attributing their success to mobilising the public to bring pressure to bear on MEPs. In thanking supporters, the UK's Open Rights Group (ORG) cautioned that Karel de Gucht, current European Commissioner for Trade, deferred any decision as to how the Commission will move forward until after a ruling from the European Court of Justice on ACTA's compatibility with European law.
 The controversial copyright- and trademark-related trade agreement previously provoked massive rallies and demonstrations across Europe. A petition against ACTA accrued two million signatures. In an editorial on the resounding defeat, where MEPs held up placards post-vote which read ""Hello Democracy Goodbye ACTA"", The Guardian's technology editor Charles Arthur said the agreement ""didn't stand a chance"". Arthur pointed out that some of the counterfeiting problems ACTA was, in part, supposed to address are  ones which should concern people, particularly the risks associated with fake drugs. However, with the vague wording of the trade agreement raising the possibility of travellers' electronic devices being searched for copyright-infringing content at customs and border checkpoints, he concluded the secretly-negotiated deal ""never stood a chance against the internet tidal wave"" of opposition.
 Arthur also highlighted that secrecy surrounding the drafting of ACTA encouraged widespread public opposition; negotiations began under the presidency of George W.

 ""ACTA has become a symbol for policy made in secrecy"" ((de))German language: ‍ACTA ist ein Symbol für Politik im Hinterzimmer geworden, stated Sebastian Nerz, vice-president of the Pirate Party of Germany.

Die Wahrung der Grundrechte und Bürgerfreiheiten im Netz scheint zumindest für die Abgeordneten des Europäischen Parlaments nicht nur ein leeres Wort.
 Protesters criticised the vague wording and legal uncertainty ACTA would have introduced. Widespread censorship of the internet and curtailment of freedom of speech were feared; patent regulations were  highlighted as having potentially adverse impact on access to medicines and crop seeds. The trade agreement, which US-based pressure group Accessnow.org described as ""giving the U.S. a structural competitive advantage over other countries"", had already amongst its signatories Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States.
 The long-running campaign against ACTA can in part be traced to publication of a leaked draft of the agreement on whistleblowing site Wikileaks. Their analysis concluded one part of the document was ""a 'Pirate Bay killer' "", and the then-leaked draft would force internet service providers to provide ""perfunctionary[sic] disclosure of customer information"" and would ""likely outlaw multi-region CD/DVD players.""

"," BRUSSELS — The head of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, has revised his choice of 25 Commissioners after he was forced to withdraw his last list of candidates. Controversy was sparked by his choice of conservative Italian Rocco Buttiglione for the Justice Commissioner position, who made several statements regarding homosexuality and women that members of the European Parliament objected to.
 His new line-up, according to the BBC, is mostly identical to his previous one; only two previous candidates (the Italian Buttiglione and the Latvian Ingrīda Ūdre) have been replaced. The European Parliament voted in favour the Commissioners on November 18th, giving Barroso and his staff the green light to start their official five-year term starting on Monday. While the Greens, Eurosceptics and the Communist Party voted against, the Commission secured the approval of the Parliament's biggest parties - the Socialists, the Liberals and the European People's Party. The vote ended with 449 in favour, 149 against and 82 abstentions, CNN reports.

"," Professor Bronisław Geremek, a former Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, a member of European Parliament and chairman of the Freedom Union, has died today at the age of 76 in a car crash near Nowy Tomyśl, Poland. The accident occurred about 13:15 Polish time (12:15 UTC) along the way 92 near Lubień in the Greater Poland Voivodeship. 
 According to the spokeswoman of the Greater Poland Voidodeships's police, Hanna Wachowiak, Geremek died when the Mercedes he was driving collided head-on with a Fiat Ducato on the road from Warsaw to the German border. The reason of Geremek's car crossing to the other side of the road and crashing into the oncoming car is still unknown. ""The officers are investigating the reasons of the accident. They have interrogated first witnesses"", said Mariusz Sokołowski, the spokesman of the Main Command of Police in an interview with the Polish news channel TVN 24. Bronisław Geremek was the only casualty of the crash; the driver of the Fiat and his passenger as well as the passenger of Geremek's Mercedes have been transported to hospitals in Poznań and Nowy Tomyśl. 
 The daily Dziennik writes it was not the excessive speed which caused the crash. The newspaper's Internet news service informs that both cars were driving with the speed of 90-100 km/h (56-62 mph). The daily reports it is assumed that Bronisław Germemek might have collapsed when driving; other assumptions include a defect of the car. ""It lasted for a split of seconds. I don't even know how it happened. I haven't seen anything wrong happening to professor"", told Geremek's passenger the police officers.
 Bronisław Geremek was born on March 6, 1932 in Warsaw, Poland. Being a historian by training, he was an associate professor of the Polish Academy of Sciences (Polska Akademia Nauk, PAN), a member of the democratic opposition in the Polish People's Republic, a member of Sejm from 1989 to 2001 and a chairman of the political party Freedom Union. He served as a Minister of Foreign Affairs of Poland from October 31, 1997 to June 30, 2000. He was also a member of the European Parliament from July 20, 2004 onwards. 
 Bronisław Geremek is survived by two sons.
 President Lech Kaczyński, who is currently in France having talks on his stance on the Treaty of Lisbon with president Nicolas Sarkozy, said: ""It is a very sad news, I am deeply moved. He was my political opponent, but at the same time a man I met in August [1980], one of the main builders of August, an undoubtedly outstanding politician, who has a great place in our history. We had other beliefs after 1989, but Bronisław Geremek was undoubtedly an extremely intelligent man"". Kaczyński is also reported to have asked Sarkozy for one minute's silence in memory of Geremek at a European political summit that took place on Friday. 
 The French president has commented Bronisław Geremek's death, too. ""The President of the Republic has taken with emotion and sadness the note of the tragic death of Mr. Bronisław Geremek. He pays tribute to the memory of this exceptional man, a respected European parliamentarian who through his courage, his humility and his commitment without fail in the service of fundamental rights, embodied the founding values of the European ideal. The President of the Republic wishes to assure his family, relatives and the whole Polish people's of solidarity of the French people in this ordeal"", we read in a statement published today on president's official website. 
 Donald Tusk, the Polish Prime Minister, has published the following statement on his official website: ""I have taken with a great regret the note of the tragic death of Bronisław Geremek, an outstanding medievalist and activist of the democratic opposition, co-builder of August 80 and a Minister of Foreign Affairs in the independent Poland. Bronisław Geremek was a man wrapped up in the matters of Poland and Poles. He has been using his knowledge, experience and a huge international authority in Europe and in the world always for the good of Fatherland. I had the honour of working with professor Bronisław Geremek for many years; I will always remember these years. He was a man of agreement and dialogue, and his idea was to connect people, not to part them. Polish sciences and politics have lost a  great man, and many of us a great Friend"".
 ""I can't get out of shock, it is a great loss. Died a man of great talents, merits and knowledge, one of the fathers of the Polish democracy. He was a great man and patriot with a great life-sketch. A talk with him was always an adventure, intellectual and political. I have always respected his opinions and uncommon knowledge"", said Aleksander Kwaśniewski, a former Polish president. 
 José Manuel Barroso, the President of the European Commission, has also issued a statement memorising Bronisław Geremek. ""He was a European of exceptional stature, a Pole of unwavering convictions. All his life he demonstrated political courage without compromise. I hope future generations remember Bronislaw Geremek as an example of a free spirit and that he stays in our memory as one of the most powerful symbols of liberation against all oppression"", he wrote. 
 Graham Watson, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe group in the European Parliament, to which belonged Bronisław Geremek, published a statement on the official website of ALDE: ""With the tragic departure of Bronislaw Geremek Poland loses one of its heroes, a tireless architect of its independence but also of the national reconciliation. Europe also loses one of its most ardent proponents who by the power of his conviction helped enlargement become a political success. Europe mourns a symbol of its reunification. I am proud to have had such a man among the ranks of Liberals and Democrats in the European Parliament and among my friends"". 
 Many Czech politicians, including a former Czech president Václav Havel, have commented the news of the Geremek's death, too. ""The report on Bronislaw Geremek's sudden death has touched me very much. I appreciated him as a remarkably reasonable and good man, very gentle as understanding. His death is not only a loss for Poland, but for all of us who are striving for the free and decent world"", said Havel. The Czech Deputy Prime Minister and the current Foreign Affairs Minister Alexandr Vondra commented: ""Geremek participated in the birth of the Polish Solidarity, he witnessed NATO and EU enlargement... An immense loss. I offer my condolences to Poland"". Jiří Dienstbier, the first Czechoslovakian Foreign Affairs Minister, told the reporters that ""Geremek was a great personality who knew it very well what Poland should do to get rid of the burdens of the nationalist past and become a leading and active member of the European family and integration"".
 The American Jewish Committee (AJC) has issued a statement as well: ""Words do not describe this tremendous loss, for both Poland and the Jewish people. Bronisław Geremek was a statesman and diplomat of the first order, and a beloved son of Poland. He will be sorely missed"", said AJC Executive Director David A. Harris.

"," The accession treaty of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union was signed today in Luxembourg. As part of a ceremony, the treaty was signed by the heads of state of each of the 25 current EU members, as well as the Bulgarian and Romanian heads of state, in what is seen as the most important step towards EU accession.
 The signature of the accession treaty marks the transition of Bulgaria and Romania from candidate countries of the EU to accession countries, which can now send observers to the European Parliament and participate in several European Union institution meetings. The countries will also receive extra funding between today and January 1, 2007, when the two countries are set to become full members of the European Union.
 The accession treaty signing has been met with celebration in both Bulgaria and Romania. Romania also organised in Luxembourg a series of cultural events, known as Zilele României la Luxembourg (Romania's Days in Luxembourg). The cultural events included traditional Romanian music, concerts, an artistic performance and exhibitions by several important Romanian visual artists. Before the ceremony, Romanian Prime Minister Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu said:
 The 860-page treaty finalises the candidacy of the two Southeastern European states, who will now have to work hard to implement last-minute reforms until their accession date, less than 21 months away. Both states must crack down on corruption, as well as secure their external borders, strengthen the judiciary and align competition law with EU standards. Romania has recently been praised for taking decisive action against corruption, even though EU lawmakers said that there is a lot left to be done. Upon accession in 2007, Romania will also have the second-largest external border in the European Union, after Finland. Due to this, it has recently upgraded several of its border checkpoints with Ukraine and Republic of Moldova, even though more is left to be done until 2007.
 The accession treaty signed today also includes references to a safeguard clause, which makes way for a delay in accession until 2008 if either Bulgaria or Romania do not meet their commitments.
 Apart from the political reforms needed to join the European Union, EU funds will also help economic development in the two countries, enabling them to improve infrastructure, especially roads, clean up the environment and modernise their industries. While both countries are among the most developed in their region of Southeastern Europe, their per-capita income is between 30-35% of the European Union average. Therefore, when they join, they will be the two poorest countries in the EU.
 The signing of the accession treaty should also boost foreign investment to the two countries. Both countries have benefited in terms of foreign investment from being candidate countries of the EU, and their new accession country status is expected to lure more foreign investors. Romania also introduced a flat tax rate of 16% on personal income and corporate profit this year to attract more foreign investment.
 When Bulgaria and Romania join in 2007, the European Union will have a population of approximately 484 million people, 30 million more than now. It will also raise the number of its members to 27, and add two extra official languages: Bulgarian and Romanian. The Bulgarian language will be the first official language of the European Union to be written in Cyrillic script.

"," The Honourable Gail Shea, Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, opened the Canadian seal hunt amid protests by animal rights groups, at a time when bans on seal product imports are becoming more prevalent internationally.
 Seal hunters along the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Gulf of St. Lawrence are allowed to catch a maximum of 270,000 Harp Seal pups from a total estimated population of 5.5 million.  8,200 is the allowable catch of Hooded seals from an estimated population of 600,000, and seal hunters may catch 50,000 grey seals from an approximate population of 300,000. 
 The Harp seal pups may be killed as soon as they have molted their white pelts, which occurs 10 to 21 days after birth.
 It is reported that Russia has shut down the seal hunt on its shores.  The United States, Netherlands, and Belgium ban the import of seal products.  The European Parliament committee has endorsed a ban on seal product imports by the 27 European Union (EU) member states, in the form of a proposed  bill that would still allow the Canadian Inuit to trade in seal products for first nation cultural purposes. All members of the EU must approve the bill for it to become law.
 ""While we are extremely disappointed that the European Parliament has called for a ban of the trade of seal products, our position remains that any ban on a humanely conducted hunt, such as Canada's, is completely without merit. We will continue to explore all legal and diplomatic options and we will exercise our rights to their fullest extent under international trade laws if and when it becomes necessary and appropriate."" 
 ""Sealing is a significant source of income in many small, isolated coastal communities throughout Atlantic Canada, Quebec and the North, and creates critical employment opportunities for processing plants, as well as fuel, food and equipment suppliers in coastal communities,"" said Minister Shea.
 ""Our government will continue to defend the rights of Canadian sealers to provide a livelihood for their families through our humane, responsible and sustainable hunt,"" she said. ""It represents as much as 35 per cent of a sealer’s annual income and is important for thousands of families at a time of year when other fishing options are limited at best.""
 The first area to open up to the seal hunt was the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where 30 percent of the catch is allowed.
 Sixteen observer permits have been issued. ""The majority of the observers are people who protest against the seal hunt, but there are journalists and other observers as well. We try to make sure there's an even proportion of sealing activity and observer activity,""  Mr. Jenkins, Department of Fisheries and Oceans spokesman said. The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) is going to observe and record the commercial seal hunt.
 ""It's devastating to be here, to know the commercial seal hunt has started again.  It's clear that a change is on the horizon with the European Parliament voting on a proposal to ban seal-product trade in the EU and many people in the Canadian sealing industry believe that could spell the beginning of the end of the commercial seal hunt,"" commented Rebecca Aldworth, director of the Canadian chapter of Humane Society International.

"," The Chinese government released human rights activist Hu Jia from prison on Sunday after he had served over three years for subversion. His release, which had been scheduled in advance, occurred just days after controversial artist Ai Weiwei was unexpectedly released on bail after three months of detention. 
 Hu was released on the same day that Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao  began his visit to Britain, the first country  on his three-nation Europe trade tour.
 Described by the Irish Times as a ""mild-mannered, slight figure who suffers from liver ailments"", the 37-year-old Hu is  a prominent Chinese dissident who had  spent years campaigning for civil liberties, environmentalism, and on behalf of suffers of HIV/AIDS before his imprisonment. He was imprisoned in April 2008 for ""inciting to subvert state power"" by writing articles about human rights in the period before the 2008 Olympic Games. He had also given many interviews to foreign news media and government embassies. He was first  detained in December 2007 and his arrest came after he had spent more than 200 days under house arrest. In 2008 while in prison, he won the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought,  awarded by the European Parliament. 
 Hu's wife Zeng Jinyuan  said via Twitter that her husband lost his political rights upon his release and cannot speak to the media for a period of one year.  
 Hu was briefly interviewed on Sunday via telephone by Hong Kong's Cable TV, and indicated that despite the danger, he would not give up his work. ""(My parents) have told me to just be a normal citizen and don't confront the system because this system is very cruel, using the country's absolute power to violate people's dignity without restraint. But I can only tell my parents I will be careful"", he said.
 Although  recent releases of high-profile dissidents such as Hu and Ai may seem to some that China is loosening its repressive policies against dissidents, activists and academics said yesterday that the determination of the Chinese government to silence dissent has not lessened and those speaking up continue to be rounded up and detained. 
 Huang Qi, a dissident released this month from prison and  interviewed by telephone, said, ""We closely follow dozens of rights' defense cases, and I've found that that at the grassroots and lowest levels of society in China, the rights defense environment has not seen any fundamental improvements."" He warned, ""One cannot count how many ordinary people are being locked up or taken away every day.""
 However, Wan Yanhau who is a  Chinese activist living in the US said  there might be a short term diminishing of the crackdowns on human rights activists. He suggested  the government could be realizing that the harsh treatment of dissidents has not stopped recent episodes of unrest. The riots by migrant workers in the  Guangdong province and protests by ethnic Mongolians are recent examples. Further, China is receiving harsh criticism from European countries with which it wants to increase trade.
 But illegal detentions are increasing, according to  Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch, and are signs that China is not moving toward compliance with international norms.

"," On December 14th, after a single reading, the EU Parliament passed the Data Retention directive. 378 parliamentarians voted in favour of the Directive, 30 abstained and 197 voted against.
 The so-called ""Big Brother"" directive, highly controversial at least among those even aware of its existence, requires all internet and telecommunications service providers to log all traffic metadata (who called who, who visited what sites) in Europe for 6 to 24 months and turn the data over to police forces, secret services, and other organisations, as decided on by national governments.  The law was drafted and passed in three months, an extraordinarily rapid process, and was heavily influenced by earlier UK legislation that failed to pass in Britain.
 Significant aspects of this law are the lack of special measures for security and privacy of the collected data, lack of any rule as to how costs are to be reimbursed.  Such measures had been proposed as amendments, but the block vote in Parliament (following a deal between the leaders of the two largest parties, the Christian democrat-conservative European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists, and the European Commission) rejected these amendments.
 All mention of ""terrorism"" was removed from the original text, so the approved law specifies these measures for ""serious crime"" only.  The definition of ""serious crime"" is not specified.
 Partially, the law harmonises existing practice, allowing police forces to rely on retention of data for their investigations.  In certain countries, privacy laws that mandated the destruction of such data after six months have hindered investigations.  Poland, following one such case, wanted a 15 year data retention period.
 However, other influences have made the law much broader than this.  Specifically, the requirement to log all subscriber information for Internet communications has raised serious concerns amongst ISPs, and technical analysts.  The reason: the term ""communication"" is defined vaguely, as ""all emails and Internet telephony"".  There exists no technical means of logging subscriber information for such communications, short of recording every TCP and UDP packet that is carried across a network connection.  This would create such huge volumes of data that small to medium ISPs would be unable to operate, and large ISPs would have to increase their prices considerably.  All provisions in the law for reimbursement were removed - this is up to each country to decide.
 Thus the Data Retention directive, while cracking down on anonymous public communications tools such as open wifi, cybercafes, pre-paid phone cards (and possibly even public phone booths), has ignored the use of web-based email, self-hosted mail servers, chat systems, VPNs, VoIP technologies, and so on.  The premise that criminals will restrict themselves to the few simple protocols that can be monitored to extract ""subscriber information"" is weak at best.
 The technical inadequacy of this law is extreme, and is probably due to its rushed progress through the legislative system.  The main driver for this rushed process appears to be a number of national governments that are keen to increase surveillance of their own citizens, and wish EU ""backing"" for such acts.  Note that the Commission and Council do not represent an elected body but are composed of the national governments and professional civil service, and there is considerable tension between these bodies and the elected Parliament.  It is plausible that the Data Retention directive was just the first of several laws that will pass through this new ""fast track"" process.
 The Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, a lobbying association, expects, early in 2006, to see a new attempt to ""harmonise patent legislation"", the so-called ""Community Patent Directive"", which will introduce software patents by the back door.  Note that a previous attempt by the Commission and Council to impose software patents (the ""Computer Implemented Inventions directive"") was rejected by Parliament in June 2005.
 Other commentators have noted that the EU produces vast numbers of directives, about ten per month, and most of these get passed into national law only very slowly.  Ireland and Germany have stated that they will take this directive to the European Court of Justice.  However, that will not prevent other countries from implementing it in a more or less severe form.
 Italy has, in the last few months, been closing cybercafes that do not keep strict records of the identity of every user.  It is such indicators that have convinced many privacy advocates that this law is not about terrorism at all, but about monitoring and controlling civil society.

Romania's Ministry of European Integration has made public the text of the European Union's Accession Treaty with Romania and Bulgaria, making it available on its website. The text of the treaty is available freely, in Romanian, at [1].
 The Accession Treaty, which is due to be voted by the European Parliament on April 13 and signed on April 25, is the legal document facilitating Romania and Bulgaria's accession to the EU, which, according to the treaty, will take place on January 1, 2007.
 The treaty's content has been posted online in order to inform Romanians of the costs, standards and responsibilities of European Union accession. The text was published after the European Commission asked for Romania and Bulgaria to better inform their citizens of what EU accession actually means. Bulgaria similarly made available the content of the treaty, in the Bulgarian language, in early April.
 Once the Accession Treaty is signed, Romania and Bulgaria will have to withdraw from the Central European Free Trade Agreement, as they will be integrated into the EU-wide free trade area. Additionally, from April 25, the two countries will send observers to the European Parliament and will be able to participate in other European Union institutions and events as observers.
 When the two countries join in 2007, the European Union will have 27 members in total and more than 480 million citizens. The timetable for accession, and the implementation of the treaty, however, will be in jeopardy if the European Parliament fails to approve the accession of the two countries on April 13, or if the two countries are deemed unprepared for accession by the European Commission, in which case the so-called safeguard clause will come into effect, postponing accession by one year.

 Negotiators at the EU reached this decision after fifteen hours of discussions on the matter. The European Commission had wished for a budget increase of 4.9% for 2012. At the same time, the European Parliament was aiming to achieve an increase of 5.2%. Such targets were objected to by the governments of various EU member countries; they were considered ""unrealistic"". 
 The UK government welcomed the result, describing it as ""excellent"". British Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mark Hoban explained: ""We have stopped the European Commission and European Parliament's inflation-busting proposals and have delivered on the government's promise to freeze the EU budget in real terms"". One argument the British government has maintained for objecting to the European Commission and European Parliament's requests is, ""with member states facing tough decisions on spending at home, we could not afford these unrealistic demands"", according to Hoban.
 Janusz Lewandowski, EU Budget Commissioner, has described the outcome as ""clearly an austerity budget"" and has expressed concern about the ""serious risk that the European Commission will run out of funds in the course of next year, and will therefore not be able to honour all its financial obligations towards beneficiaries of EU funds"".
 Now, concern should be given towards the discussions about the long-term budget of the EU between the years 2014 and 2020, Hoban believes. BBC News Online has reported that the British government is anticipated to reject proposals from the European Commission to raise the long-term budget by five per cent. According to the Press Association, the Commission wants to increase the budget by eleven per cent in comparison to the seven years prior.

"," The European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, has publically-approved the accession of candidate countries Bulgaria and Romania, which are set to join the EU on January 1, 2007. The approval comes after Bulgaria and Romania completed accession  negotiations in June and December respectively, and the text for the Accession Treaty was completed earlier this month.
 The next step before accession will be the approval of the Accession Treaty by the European Parliament on April 13, before the document is expected to be signed on April 25.
 Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Enlargement, who is from Finland, said that the EC's approval marks a new stage in the relations between the EU and the two candidate countries, and gives a clear message that the Commission welcomes Bulgaria and Romania into the European family.
 However, Rehn also said that the two countries have a lot left to be done until their accession in less than two years. The release states that, ""The Commission will continue to carefully monitor whether the two countries respect their engagements and obligations until accession and will support the two with all the instruments at its disposal.""
 Another important mention was that of the safeguard clause, which means that if any of the two countries do not meet their reform fulfillments and there are serious problems with their progress respecting their obligations, the EU can postpone accession by one year, to 2008.
 The Romanian prime minister, Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, responded to the approval by saying that, ""The EC approval for the Accession Treaty confirms Romania is fulfilling its commitments and that the country is on schedule with the integration process.""

 Mattel, the world's largest toy producer, recently launched a massive product recall of Chinese-made products because their paint may contain excessive amounts of lead.
 China has until October to respond with a detailed plan on how it will increase its monitoring of product safety; if it fails to respond, Kuneva announced, some products will be banned.

"," On Wednesday, the European Parliament approved the ""Single European Sky II"" legislation that will lead to the creation of a single European airspace. The single European airspace will result in ""more efficient rules, leading to shorter flights, fewer delays and reduced fuel consumption"". In turn, this should result in fewer CO2 emissions and cheaper ticket prices. Implementation should be completed by 2012.
 Currently the European airspace consists of 650 parts with 60 different control centers and 27 air traffic control (ATC) zones. International flights have to switch between national air traffic control zones, also known as ""blocks"", when they enter another country. This leads to delays and bottlenecks, causing airplanes to consume more fuel.
 Euro parliamentarian Corien Wortmann stated that ""the EU countries have stepped on the break for years in creating a European airspace, because they wanted to keep influence over their own airspace. Luckily that resistance is now broken."" ((translated from Dutch))Dutch language: ‍De EU-landen hebben jarenlang op de rem gestaan bij de vorming van een Europees luchtruim, omdat ze eigen zeggenschap over hun luchtruim wilde houden. Gelukkig is die weerstand nu doorbroken. Euro parliamentarian Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert agrees: ""Everyone agrees - in theory - that this is important for security, efficiency, reliability, cost reduction, capacity improvement en durability. But self-interest of organizations and countries appeared often more important.""

 Benefits for the aviation industry over the next ten years are estimated at €2 to 3 billion. CO2 emissions should be cut with approximately 16 million tonnes.

The European Parliament has today approved the signing of the Accession Treaties of Romania and Bulgaria, effectively endorsing their accession to the European Union. The parliament voted on the Romanian Accession Treaty with 497 positive votes, 93 negative votes and 71 abstentions. Bulgaria received a slightly more positive message, with 522 votes in favour of its Accession Treaty, 70 negative votes and 69 abstentions.
 After this vote, which was legally-binding, the two countries will sign their Accession Treaties on April 25, when they will move from being candidate countries to accession countries - that is, from April 25, the two countries will send observers to the European Parliament and will receive larger amounts of pre-accession funding.
 The approval of the Accession Treaty is a very positive signal for Romania and Bulgaria, confirming their progress towards EU accession until this stage. Both countries started negotiations with the EU in 2000, and completed them in 2004.
 The approval of the Treaty is expected to encourage greater foreign investment to the two countries. Already, the fact that they were EU candidate countries has made them more competitive than their southeastern European neighbours. For example, Romania received $5.5 billion of foreign investment in 2004, triple the amount received in 2003. Bulgaria also attracted $2.54 billion, the highest per-capita amount in the region. Stocks have also risen, with the Bucharest-based BET10 exchange rising 84% in the last 12 months, and Sofia's Sofix rising 69%.
 Also, the countries will benefit from a greater role within the European Union. They will send observers to the European Parliament from April 25, which will be able to take place in debates, even though they will not have voting power. Also, the countries will receive more funding between 2005 and 2007.
 This step was one of the largest hurdles that the two countries faced before accession in 2007. Once the Accession Treaty has been signed, the only way that accession can be postponed is through the implementation of a safeguard clause by the European Commission, which can take place if either of the two countries are unprepared for joining the EU in key areas or have major problems with the last phases of accession.
 However, despite the positive effects of the Accession Treaty vote, Romania and Bulgaria still have a significant amount of work to do in order to be fully prepared to join the EU in 2007. The establishment of an independent judiciary is a major issue in both countries, as is corruption. Additionally, the European Parliament has notified Bulgaria that it must deal with organised crime in a more dynamic manner. In the case of Romania, the EU has said that more progress must be made in bringing competition law up to EU standards, as well as protecting the environment and reducing state aid to loss-making industries such as the steel sector.
 Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Enlargement, said that ""These countries still have a lot to do. They have criteria to fulfill so the safeguard clause doesn't kick in."" If the safeguard clause is implemented, accession will be postponed until 2008. However, in the case of Bulgaria, the safeguard clause can only be implemented if all 25 member states vote unanimously on it. In the case of Romania, only a majority vote is needed.
 In either case, analysts are predicting that both countries would have to face very major problems in key areas for the safeguard clause to go into effect.

 The European Parliament has rejected the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions (software patent directive) sustained by lobbies of large software publicists such as the corporations Microsoft, Siemens, Nokia and Alcatel, grouped under the title of the European Information & Communications Technology Industry Association (EICTA, [1]). The directive involved the granting of software patents.
 648 MEPs out of 680 rejected the text, 18 voted for and 14 abstained.
 A rejection vote became the expected outcome when the European People's Party, initially in favour of the directive, decided to reject it.
 The European Greens, Socialist Group and European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party also voted for rejection of the directive for heterogeneous reason. Michel Rocard, author of a number of amendments to the original directive, said that the majority of the modifications were unlikely to be supported by the Commission and Council, with whom the Parliament would have had to enter a Conciliation procedure if it had voted for maintaining the directive in moditifed form. ""Better have no text at all than a bad one"", he added.
 Before the vote, Rocard pointed at the irritation of the Parliament towards the Commission: ""There is collective anger throughout the Parliament because of the way the directive was handled by the Commission and the Council"".
 During the debate on Tuesday, Commissioner Joaquín Almunia told MEPs: ""Should you decide to reject the common position, the Commission will not submit a new proposal."".
 The rejection was welcomed by small and medium software companies, as well as by Free Software supporters. The Directive had been subject to an intense campaigning, within the Parliament, in the news media and on the Internet.  The supporters of the Council position appear to have spent several ten millions, hiring prestigious PR agencies with at least 30-40 lobbyists who roamed the halls of the Parliament every day for 3 months, and many full-page advertisements in EU newspapers such as European Voice, EU Reporter etc.  The opponents of software patentability (that is supporters of the position taken by the European Parliament in its 1st reading of 24 September 2003), coordinated under the roof of the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure (FFII), also had several lobbyists stationed in Brussels, conducted several conferences and demonstrations and published some newspaper advertisements, with a total budget of nearly 100,000 eur apart from countless unpaid working hours of a dedicated supporter base, consisting mainly of programmers and software entrepreneurs.

 ""This is a great victory for those who have campaigned to ensure that European innovation and competitiveness is protected from monopolisation of software functionalities and business methods. It marks the end of an attempt by the European Commission and governmental patent officials to impose detrimental and legally questionable practices of the European Patent Office (EPO) on the member states,"" said the Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure, in opposition to the directive.
 Adversaries to the patent directive claim that a bill covering Intellectual Property (IP) would ""stifle innovation"" in Europe, as it allows the patenting of implementation within software. Many anti-patent activists say that if the bill were passed, small businesses and hobbyists would be in danger of lawsuit from corporations and their extensive patent portfolios.

"," The controversial European Union Directive on the Patentability of Computer Implemented Inventions, also called the ""software patent directive"" has been put to rest for 2004. The directive was expected to easily pass through the European Council's Fisheries Council on Tuesday, December 21, but was removed from the agenda at the request of 
Poland's Minister of Science and Computerisation, Wlodzimierz Marcinski. 
 The directive's opponents, some of whom had conceded defeat on Tuesday before the vote was taken, will continue the debate informally until meetings resume in 2005. 
 Software developers, who supported the European Parliament's proposal last year to definitively rule out software patents, welcomed the delay as a chance to reintroduce those provisions into the current draft.
 Florian Mueller, campaign manager of NoSoftwarePatents.com, which is supported by three IT companies (1&1, Red Hat, and MySQL AB), applauded Poland's move.
 ""The Polish government deserves greatest admiration for its courage!"" said Mueller in a press release. ""Now Europe has the opportunity to have a constructive debate on the severe shortcomings of the current Council text, under the new Luxembourgish EU presidency next year."" 
 Germany's representative also backed the delay, saying it would allow everyone to align the current proposal to changes proposed by the European Parliament last year. 
 ""We were well aware that [the current proposal] has room for improvement with an eye to the objective of arriving at a consensus position between the EU Council and the European Parliament,"" Germany's Federal Minister of Justice Brigitte Zypries said in a Tuesday statement. ""We will continue to work constructively toward finding a solution that even better meets the needs of those concerned than the decision taken in May of this year.""
 On May 18, 2004 EU Council reached a political agreement on a ""Common Position"" on the directive which ignored the European Parliament's vote from last year. The Council vote generated a lot of controversy. Later, the Dutch parliament failed to convince its EU representatives to reverse their vote. 
 According to the new voting weights which took effect on November 1, the majority needed to formally adopt the Common Position (after translations were done) is questionable. The 20 countries that supported the Directive on May 18 fall short of the new qualified majority by 16 votes.

 The EU Climate Law, agreed after 14 hours of negotiations includes the establishment of a 15-member independent body to advise on proposed climate policies and increased investment in ""carbon sinks"".  According to members of the European Parliament (MEP) those will ensure 57% net reduction target is in place.  This claim has been disputed by senior policy officer for climate and energy at the European Environmental Bureau Barbara Mariani, who says the measures equal a 52.8% cut in actual emissions.
 A September 2020 press release by the European Commission (EC) promised ""[f]ollowing broad public consultation and thorough impact assessments, the Commission will come forward with the corresponding legislative proposals by June 2021"", including, according to the BBC News a limit on CO2 removal that counts toward the target, encouraging member states to actually reduce carbon emissions instead of merely removing them. ""Adopting the new target in time would allow the EU to communicate its higher ambition to international partners well ahead of the 2021 UN Climate Conference (COP26) in Glasgow and set the bar for others to follow"", the press release read.
 This decision means the EU is to spend at least 30% of its €1.8 trillion long-term budget on the concerns related to the climate.  Poland has adopted its own climate strategy.  According to Reuters, Poland is the only EU member state to refuse a pledge to climate neutrality, instead aiming to reduce emissions by 30% by 2030.  The country relies on coal for 80% of its electricity, but will move towards renewable energy and its first nuclear power plant, Reuters reported.
 The EC president Ursula von der Leyen said the decision leads ""the EU on a green path for a generation"".  Criticising this decision, MEP Michael Bloss said, ""[w]e fought hard but achieved little"", as well as saying the law was a ""big disappointment.""  Director of Climate Action Network Europe Wendel Trio said ""[t]he 'at least 55% emission reduction target for 2030' is not in line with the Paris Agreement's ambition to limit temperature rise to 1.5C by the end of the century"", adding the law was ""rushed"" and ""not the kind of climate law that will help the EU to lead the global efforts to tackle climate change"".
 MEP and chair of the European Parliament's environmental committee Pascal Canfin said ""it was not possible"" to convince the member states ""to change the wording 'at least 55 net'"", and while ""parliament was obviously ready to go even further"", he said ""the compromise found is ambitious: we are going to do two and a half times more in nine years than what we have done in the last 10 years in Europe.""
 According to The Guardian under current measures the EU is expected to reduce emissions by 46% by 2030.  The EC's press release said between 1990 and 2019, green house gas emissions fell by a quarter.
 Per multiple reports, the United Kingdom set its target to 78% by 2035.

On Saturday the countries of Cyprus, France (for part of Outre-mer), Italy (day 1), Latvia, Malta,  Slovakia and the Czech Republic all voted. On Sunday, the final day of polling, the remaing countries of Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy (day 2), Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia and Sweden voted. Votes were released last night and will continue to be released over the course of today with the exception of Netherlands, which has broken rules and partialy released them on Friday.
 The European Parliament is divided into constituencies, which have a group of representatives (the MEPs). Each constituency elects them proportionaly. The amount of MEPs representing a political party depends on the percentage of votes they gain. For example, if 50% of the electorate of a constituency vote for the x party then 50% of the MEPs in that constituency will be from the x party. In total there are 736 MEPs up for election by approximately 500,000,000 Europeans across 27 member states making it the largest transnational election in history.
 The elections didn't quite go to plan across the Netherlands, as the European Commission have asked that Dutch officials give an explanation to results they released. As countries across Europe vote on different days, the results of the election can only be released on the last day (Sunday), so that the results in other countries will not influence the decission made by people in countries that are still voting. Despite this, the Netherlands released some of their results on Friday: 92% of the votes have currently been counted. Further controversy arose from the results themselves. Results so far show that far-right Dutch Member of Parliament, Geert Wilders's party the Party for Freedom (PVV), appears to have come second behind the Christian Democratic Appeal. Wilders is facing prosecution in the Netherlands for an anti Islamic statement and was refused entry to the United Kingdom on grounds of the intent to incite hatred. 
 It had initially been foreseen that the Treaty of Lisbon would have entered into force by the time of these elections, making them the first to be held under its provisions. However, primarily because of the failure of the referendum in Ireland, the framework established by the Treaty of Nice will be used again. Amongst other differences, the number of MEPs to be returned depends upon which rules are in effect: while 736 MEPs will be elected under the Nice rules, this number would have increased to 751 if the Lisbon Treaty were in force. A further change that Lisbon would have brought was an increase to the powers of Parliament, including powers over the appointment of the President of the European Commission.
 In the previous election, German Hans-Gert Pöttering of the centre-right EPP-ED won with 34% and Martin Schulz of the Socialists came second with 26%. Despite this, during the last term the two leaders shared, each serving approximately two years in office. 
 Europeans have also been voting in local elections of County Councils in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

 After a Roma gipsy was accused of murdering the wife of an Italian naval officer recently, Ms Mussolini told the Romanian newspaper Cotidianul on November 2nd: ""Breaking the law has become a way of life for Romanians. However, it is not about petty crimes, but horrifying crimes, that give one goose bumps.""
 In her comment, Ms. Mussolini did not distinguish between Roma gipsies and the rest of Romanians, which the leader of the Romanian deputies, Corneliu Vadim Tudor, found to be ""a sacrilege toward our people"". The far-right Greater Romania Party is running on an anti-Romani platform. Mr. Tudor went on to suggest that such a comment could be expected from the grand-daughter of Benito Mussolini, which Ms. Mussolini saw as an insult to her family.
 After these five Romanian Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) left, the ITS only had 18 members left, whereas 20 members from six countries are needed to form a faction.
 As a result of the dissolution, these MEPs will no longer be able to amend laws in the plenary meetings of the European Parliament, they will get less time to speech, and they will not be able to use the translator service or ask for certain financial contributions for their meetings. The bloc now misses out on an estimated €1.3 million.
 Immigration tensions have soared recently in Italy, resulting in the expulsion of 20 Romanians. Since Romania joined the European Union, their citizens should be able to travel freely within the European Union, but Italy is considering restrictions on this right.
 Beside the Greater Romania MEPs and several politicians from Italy, the ITS bloc was composed of members from Austria (FPÖ), Belgium (Vlaams Belang), Bulgaria (National Union Attack), France (Front National) and individual politicians from the United Kingdom.
 Attempts to form a far-right coalition in the European Parliament had previously been undertaken, but the ITS faction only came together last January, after Romania and Bulgaria had joined the European Union on January 1.
 The survival of the group was already doubtful, according to polls which predicted an electoral wipeout for the Greater Romania party in the elections on November 20.
 Several other political groups welcomed the break up, and the official announcement today was reportedly followed by some applause. 
 German MEP Martin Schulz, head of the left Party of European Socialists, released a statement saying that: ""The good news is that the [group] of the ultra-nationalists no longer exists and cannot use the money of the European taxpayer to support its xenophobia and neo-fascism.""
 According to allied Liberal leader Graham Watson: ""They are a casualty of their own philosophy which paints all foreigners into a single mould and encourages xenophobic and racist comments and remarks which have no place in the European Union. ... The irony of a Mussolini destroying the coherence of a far-right group will not be lost on Europeans from Bucharest to Brindisi.""
 English green MEP Jean Lambert put it this way: ""This collection of unsavoury European politicians were united only by hatred — be it of other races, nationalities, sexualities or, ironically, the EU — and it was only a matter of time before they succumbed to a hatred of each other as well.""

A 70% turnout is very large compared to Spain 42%.
 The result comes as no surprise to European political commentators as opinion polls had consistently suggested that the ""No"" camp was on course for a strong victory. Indeed, the last opinion poll before the actual referendum suggested a 56% win for the ""No"" camp.
 The treaty was supported by all 3 major political parties (center-left PS, center-right UMP, center-right UDF), though a significant minority of the PS, and some in the UMP, chose to oppose it.
It was opposed by the French Communist Party, as well as Trotskyite movements such as the Revolutionary Communist League, other far-left movements such as the Party of the Workers, parts of the Socialist party, parts of The Greens some members of UMP, and the nationalist National Front.
 According to polls, the vast majority of blue collar workers, farmers and other categories threatened by globalization and international concurrence voted against the treaty. The urban, better educated or richer population voted in favor.
 Some supporters of the ""No"" camp have argued that the mainstream media was biased in favor of the ""yes"" cause, and this was supported by some analyses of times awarded by television to both camps. However, the ""no"" camp also waged an aggressive campaign, with the walls of major cities being plastered with posters linking the EU Constitution and the European Union to all kind of social ills, such as high unemployment.

 Note, however, that such polls offer only a limited number of answers and may thus misrepresent the actual motives of the people.
 Proponents of the ""No"" vote, both on the left and right, argued that the proposed constitution enshrined what they claim is an undemocratic Europe, with much of the responsibilities granted to a body of unelected political appointees, the European Commission and not enough checks and balances. They also point out that it vests much legislative power in the European Council, representing the executives of the various countries; this is seen as a bad arrangement with respect to Separation of powers. While the treaty adds supplemental powers for the directly elected European Parliament, many opponents, particularly on the left, consider that they are still insufficient in order to provide checks and balances.
 Much criticism was directed at the length of the proposed Constitution. The real treaty submitted to French voters is about 80 pages long, which many argue is too long and complex for a constitution. It is followed by 100 pages of appendices, declarations and protocols, some of them dealing with matters such as oil refining in the Dutch West Indies or specific nuclear power plants in Eastern Europe.
 Opponents of the treaty argue that the proposed constitution will largely hamstring the French government and prevent it from leading its own policies in matters as diverse as social services or foreign policy.
 Much of the opposition was targeted at Part III of the proposed constitution, which sets the policies of the European Union. Opponents point out that the constitutions of most countries, including France, do not specify policies explicitly, except for a limited number of fundamental rights, but rather are limited to specifying the core principles and procedures of how governmental institutions work. Part III, they argued, sets in stone a number of economic and social choices, while these should be a matter of political choice depending on democratic votes.
 Both left-wing and right-wing opponents consider that some of these policies, already applied and enforced by the European Union, are disastrous for France's economy and society as well as European's economy and society. One primary target is the free trade policies with countries having less expensive workforce and social protection, which, they argue, drive French workers out of work (2.7 million French people are out of work).
 This was recently exemplified by the so-called ""Bolkestein directive"", which would have enabled service providers in the European Union to work anywhere in the union according to the legislation and social practices of their own country, not of the country where they'd work: this was caricatured as the example of the ""Polish plumber"" coming to work for a meager fraction of what French plumbers demand.
 Much is made of délocalisations — that is, the transferring of industries and, now, services to countries with lower production costs, depriving French workers of jobs at a time when unemployment is high.
 As a consequence, both left-wing and right-wing opponents of the treaty and of current and proposed European Union policies argue in favor of some sort of protectionism.
 In the field of international relations, many opponents contend that the proposed constitution would make the European Union largely subservient to NATO, an institution dominated by the United States of America.
 A factor in the opposition to the constitution is the recent enlargement of the European Union, a major move which was not approved by a referendum. Opponents consider that open border concurrence with much poorer economies is bad for French economy; many express uneasiness at subsidizing and collaborating with governments that they consider subservient to the interests of the United States, such as Poland's (Poland chose to buy warplanes from the United States after receiving some European Union subsidies, a movement which resulted in many questioning the financial and diplomatic priorities of their government).
 Finally, many seized the occasion to express their discontent at France's political elite and to president Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin's government. While unemployment had receded under the rule of center-left former prime minister Lionel Jospin, it has climbed against under Raffarin's administration despite his and Chirac's promises.
 Much opposition was directed towards what many on the Left consider the ""ultra-liberal"" character of the Constitution: that is, they argue, the proposed constitution makes permanent economic policies which they consider disastrous for French society:
 Left wing opponents, they say, want Europe, but another Europe, which, in their view, would put the concerns of common people before those of financial markets and the wealthy. They contend that free market capitalism, which they consider enforced by the constitution, destroys lives and benefits the financial establishment, but not the average worker. They argue that open trade and concurrence encourages unemployment in France.
 They argue, bluntly, that the constitution is the constitution of right-winger Chirac and MEDEF, the union of larger French private employers. MEDEF, due to its current leader Ernest-Antoine Seillière, is very unpopular among the left.
 Left-wing opponents argued that the Charter of rights included in the constitution was largely indicative, not prescriptive. They questioned the say that other members of the union may have in matters such as the right to abortion and the separation of Church and State, which they consider threatened by certain governments from Catholic countries, which, during the negotiation of the treaties, had insisted on adding references to the Christian heritage of Europe.
 Another argument from the left was that the Constitution called for member states to strengthen their military forces. Opponents argue that this would be wasteful spending, would result in an arm race with the United States, China and others, and would result in wars and more instability.
 Many leaders of the opposition to the ""No"" also simply called for a blow to Chirac.
 Many right-wing opponents argue that Turkey, which has applied for European Union membership, should not become a member, and that acceptance of the Constitution would pave the way for this. They point out that the new Eastern European members, whose joining many of them opposed, were accepted without a referendum; they also point out that Turkey is for the most part not located in Europe, but in the Middle-East, and that it borders countries such as Iran and Iraq.
 In addition, many supporters of the right-wing are opposed to a union with countries whose culture they consider too far from France, and are concerned about unchecked immigration from these. They also consider that the direction the European Union is heading will only reinforce unchecked immigration from poor Muslim countries, which they think is bad socially and economically for Europe. This point of view is disputed by many economists, who point out that due to aging of France and other European countries increasing immigration is the only viable option for boosting the existing economies.
 Such arguments are likely not to have much impact on many French voters. The results of this referendum, as well as those of the 2002 presidential election, show some deep distrust of the population for the political class as well as for ""experts"". There is high skepticism against economists and politicians who promote what they consider to be necessary reforms, whereas despite those reforms unemployment has remained high and standards of living have lessened for many.
 Supporters of the proposed European Constitution contend that it is a marked improvement over preceding treaties governing the European Union. They point out that it gives increased powers to the directly elected European Parliament compared to the politically appointed European Commission and European Council. They also point out that it gives a right of petition to European citizens, which they contend is a marked democratic advance. Opponents point out that this right may be exercised only with strict conditions (1,000,000 signatures from a ""significant"" number of countries) and with uncertain consequences. Furthermore, they point out that the basic undemocratic handling and procedures followed for the legislative enactment of laws are kept in place, and that neither the EC or the counsel of ministers have been internally made more democratic.
 Proponents of the constitution consider that these improvements make the European Union markedly more democratic than it was before, while opponents may be of the opinion that something which is better then extremely bad, is still no good, and consider a no-vote a chance to come up with something better. Some supporters of the constitution contend that certain European measures that many consider ill-advised (such as the Bolkestein directive or the directive on software patents) would not have been adopted if the stronger checks and balances provided for by the constitution had been implemented, but there is little actual basis to support such a claim.
 Part II of the proposed European Constitution is a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This charter lists a number of human rights, such as the prohibition of torture, the prohibition of the death penalty, etc., and reinstates that the Union follows the Council of Europe's (COE) European Convention on Human Rights and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). All members of the European Union must belong to the COE and accept ECHR jurisdiction. Proponents of the constitution consider that this reinstatement of human rights is of great import, especially with respect to recent new members, which may not have much of a tradition of democracy, rule of law and human rights.
 Proponents of the constitution dispel the accusation that the constitution is ultra-libéral (i.e. supports unfettered free market and prohibits social policies in member countries). They contend that these dispositions are not new, and were already to be found in the 1957 Treaty of Rome. They point out that unbiased concurrence is a the heart of European policies since the beginnings of the European Economic Community.
 They contend that, for a large part, the proposed constitution is just the consolidation of the preceding treaties governing the European Union into a single document.
 They admit out that the Constitution, like all works designed by a committee out of compromise, may be bulky. However, they point out, France cannot expect to force its choices on other countries. While some French parties may have preferred that the constitution contains more ""social"" dispositions, such social dispositions would be opposed by countries such as the United Kingdom, and there is little hope that any renegotiation would get them accepted. French Citizens, they claim, should be ready to accept an imperfect text.
 Some supporters say that refusing the constitution will diminish the clout of France in European institutions and may make it more difficult in the future to have its interests be taken into account at that level.
 Some right-wing supporters of the treaty contend that the European Union is a necessary force in order to push what they consider to be necessary reforms upon France.
 Supporters of the treaty point out that the question of the constitution is disconnected from that of the accession of Turkey. President Chirac has pledged that the accession of Turkey would be put to a referendum before French voters (the accession treaty of former Eastern Bloc countries was ratified by the French Parliament without a referendum).
 Finally, supporters of the proposed Constitution point out that this referendum is about the ratification of a treaty, and is not a plebiscite on the actions of president Jacques Chirac and prime minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin, both of which are deeply unpopular.

"," Britain has stated that it will reconsider the asylum application of a gay Iranian teenager who believes he will be persecuted for his sexuality if he is deported back to Iran. The announcement Friday by the British government came after the European Parliament urged a resolution to the case and said that Iran has a history of torturing and executing homosexuals.
 Britain had initially rejected an asylum request by 19-year-old Mehdi Kazemi, and Kazemi fled to the Netherlands, where his case was turned down and he returned to Britain. British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith released a statement on the case: ""Following representations made on behalf of Mehdi Kazemi, and in the light of new circumstances since the original decision was made, I have decided that Mr. Kazemi's case should be reconsidered on his return to the UK from the Netherlands."" 
 Eighty members of Britain's upper house of Parliament sent a letter to Jacqui Smith, appealing to the government to ""show compassion and allow Mr. Kazemi to have a safe haven in the United Kingdom."" Roger Roberts of the House of Lords initiated the petition, and stated: ""There is no doubt that he will be persecuted and possibly face state-sanctioned murder if he is forced to return."" Simon Hughes, Member of Parliament for North Southwark and Bermondsey, said he would support Kazemi if he returns to the United Kingdom: ""I hope Mr Kazemi will now come back to Britain where arrangements are already in place for an urgent meeting with him, his family, specialist lawyers and myself to prepare a new application to the Home Office.""
 Gay rights advocate and spokesman for the British gay rights group OutRage!, David Allison commented ""It's cruel to even suggest sending him back ... The history of gays in Iran has been horrific."" Ben Summerskill of the British gay rights organization, Stonewall, said: ""We are obviously delighted that the home secretary has listened to the representations that were made in this case ... There are overwhelming reasons why people should not be deported to Iran in the current circumstances, and it is important that Britain is seen as a safe haven.""
 Borg Palm, Kazemi's solicitor, stated Kazemi was pleased with the news but would have an unstable future in Britain without asylum: ""He is very much afraid of being allowed to stay in Britain but without being granted official permission. That would then put him in a no man’s land. He would be very unhappy in the long term.""
 Kazemi came to Britain in 2005 to study English. His uncle spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity, and said that his nephew was studying in Britain in 2006 when his partner in Iran was arrested and hanged after being charged with sodomy. Kazemi's uncle told CNN: ""Under torture and pressure, (the partner) revealed Mehdi's name as his boyfriend."" Gay sex is considered a crime in Iran, and is punishable by death. Kazemi told British authorities in his asylum application that Iranian police were after him, and that he could face execution if he returned to Iran. Kazemi stated in his asylum request: ""I cannot stop my attraction to men ... If I return to Iran I will be arrested and executed like [my boyfriend]. Since this incident ... I have been so scared.""
 After Britain's Home Office initially denied Kazemi's asylum application, he fled to Canada and then the Netherlands, where he was detained. Kazemi faces deportation from the Netherlands to Britain, after their highest court rejected his plea on Tuesday. The Netherlands' highest court rejected the case, citing EU law that Kazemi's case was the responsibility of the country where he first requested asylum.
 A resolution passed by the European Parliament Thursday asked EU states ""to find a common solution to ensure that Mehdi Kazemi is granted asylum or protection on EU soil and not sent back to Iran."" The resolution also stated that Iranian authorities ""routinely detain, torture and execute persons, notably homosexuals"" and that ""Mehdi's partner has already been executed, while his father has threatened him with death.""  
 In a September 2007 speech at Columbia University, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was challenged by University president Lee Bollinger for Iran's treatment of gays.  Ahmadinejad stated that ""In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country,"" drawing laughter from the audience. ""In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it."" According to Iranian human rights activists, over 4,000 gay men and lesbians have been executed since the Iranian Revolution of 1979.

File:Anna Mikkola.jpg
"," Anna Mikkola is running for European Parliament in Finland as a member of the eco-socialist Left Alliance party. At the age of 28 she's the youngest member of the 14 candidates on the Left Alliance's list for the multi-national body. She spoke to Wikinews during a break in campaigning. Finland votes in the European Parliament election on June 7.
 Thanks for joining us, Anna.
 ((Anna Mikkola)) Thanks for asking. I had a convenient break in the campaign this afternoon.
 ((WN)) You're the youngest member of your party's list in the Euro elections; but you've also had an extensive career in politics already. How did you first get involved in political activity?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) I believe I was 16 or 17 at the time, and I just stopped by at the local party office and asked if there was something I could do. There had just been a general election in Finland and the conservatives widely spoke of things I could not accept. Like [how] public financing for culture and sports is unnecessary. One politician even suggested young people could spend their time climbing trees and not expect society to provide them with facilities.
 ((WN)) So from there you went straight into the Left Youth. How did you choose that party? Did you explore others?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) It was between the Green party and the Left Alliance. The Greens I felt concentrated too much on individual life style choices as a method of doing politics, so I chose the Left Alliance. I have always been the sort of person who likes to think of structures and their effects, the big picture in a social sense if you may.
 ((WN)) So what's it like campaigning for a nationally-elected office? Is it like organizing youth locally or does it feel basically different?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) Basically different. The whole country is one constituency, which means more traveling than most people do in a year. It's also expensive as in our election system candidates have to buy their way into public knowledge. Luckily I have both an extensive election team covering the whole country and also some financial support from the Left Youth movement.
 ((WN)) You mentioned last night waiting for a bus and seeing three with pictures of you on the side pass by...
 ((Anna Mikkola)) It's kind of absurd. I have ads in public transport in the 6 biggest cities in Finland. You are definetely more conscious of yourself when you're traveling on a bus or tram that has your face on it.
 ((WN)) Now, Finland's role in the world has fundamentally changed in your lifetime: from a neutral state with closer ties to the Soviet Union than many others in democratic Europe, to EU member and now potentially to NATO member. Do you think your youth makes it easier for you to adapt to the changes going on?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) Well, it makes my relationship with Finland's EU membership definetely easier and less emotional maybe than for many older people. Finland has been in the EU my whole adulthood, so for me membership is not the question. I am more interested in looking at the content. I think the new political generation of around 30 year olds, who are making their breakthrough, are going to change political discourse substantially.
 ((WN)) Do you see green & socialist politics as being the key to this younger generation? In your view can you have environmentalism without socialism?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) We have an interesting Green party in Finland, who have accepted the necessity of additional nuclear power and support market mechanisms as a part of their climate policy without any questions or caveats. So yes, there is an attempt to create a green capitalist system. The youth as well are divided on this issue. Many people however do see the problems of turning the environment or climate action into products you can buy or sell and speculate with. In that sense I feel environmentalism cannot be separated from socialism, which has a fundamentally different logic.
 ((WN)) The other end, though, to the importance of the youth vote is voter apathy; how do you deal with the situation of ""celebrity"" candidates, in particular far-right candidates like Timo Soini?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) In European elections the problem is apathy in general, not just youth apathy. But maybe you can separate between two types: many older people do not vote in these elections because they don't like the EU and/or because they feel they cannot change anything by voting since the EU is too big and too far way. These are choices, often resulting from considering the options. Many young people do not vote in elections in general, because they do not really even notice them. Their apathy is not a result of a decision, but genuinely a product of being out of the whle political process. This is something Timo Soini cannot change I think. His candidacy is a big risk for him in any case, since his party is a one man show to a great extent. If he buries himself in Brussels it might well be the end of that party.
 ((WN)) You've been working in Brussels yourself for over a year now; how did you stay in touch with the situation in Finland before the campaign began?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) Mostly by visiting Finland often. It's been two years that I have worked in the European parliament now. Working as a parliamentary assistant to a Finnish MEP kind of means you need to be aware of what is happening in Finland and what the papers are saying about it.
 ((WN)) Now let's talk policy; on your website you mention numerous issues with the Lisbon treaty but also say that EU membership isn't an either-or consideration. If you could re-write Lisbon, what would you take out, what would you put in?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) Simply put I would take out all the militarisation stuff, and remove the neoliberal economic thinking of no rules for the financial markets, and maybe remove some of the new policy areas. I would put in a social progress clause that would ensure rights (especially worker's rights) inside the EU and add a recognition for e.g. cross border strikes.
 ((WN)) On the subject of militarization, what would be the best alternative to the European Defence Agency? What's the right path, if any, for collective European defense?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) Defense is a word that is understood very differently in different European countries. The Finnish tend to understand this term as passive defense, but many — especially old colonial countries — understand it in a more active sense, as including pre-emptive and aggressive operations outside EU borders. I believe the right path to be a firm concentration on non-aggressive peacekeeping. As for a common European defense, I am against the idea because of the abovementioned reasons. The European Defence Agency is basically an arms trading operation, when its role would maybe be better in co-ordination of crisis management and peacekeeping.
 ((WN)) So in the long run should the other countries in Europe leave NATO as well?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) That is for them to decide. However any European defence organisation would be based on NATO, and would not respect the status of non-allied countries. I believe the European Union should respect it.
 ((WN)) With regard to workers' rights, a number of parties on the left have raised objections to the Posted Workers Directive and the European Court of Justice's positions on the rights of workers from one EU country working in another. Finland both receives foreign workers and sends workers elsewhere; how could the Posted Workers Directive be best fixed, in your view?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) There is no point in fixing the directive. The ECJ's decisions have been based on the Treaties, and override the directive, which itself is actually not too bad. This is why European trade organisations too have been demanding a social progress clause I mentioned earlier to be put in the Lisbon Treaty, which would be the only way to fix the situation. So that the rights of workers could not be overriden by for example the free movement of services, which has happened in most of the ECJ decisions.
 ((WN)) And what are the practical chances that such a clause would be put in?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) Close to zero at this point. However the Lisbon Treaty most probably will not be the last Treaty in the EU. And of course the Irish will still vote on it for a second time. Should the result be a no this time too, the chances would increase. What is not widely being talked of is that were are now in a situation where the EU is doing its best to get into effect a Treaty that was negotiated years ago and is founded on an economic logic that has clearly failed. This does not seem to bother most people.
 ((WN)) But given that this process has taken so long, do you think the will for a new Treaty would be present — especially with the current Treaty having passed most national parliaments by solid majorities only a year ago?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) Solid majorities...The Finnish parliament started its proceedings with it before a translation was available. Then they ratified without any public discussion. I think there would be will, but it is clearly not appropriate to talk about it, since the Lisbon Treaty is presented as the only option. Besides, tax payers pay the politicians to do their job. With that money one would assume they would not say they don't have the energy for a new Treaty.
 ((WN)) What place does the organized left have in a post-Lisbon Europe? Would they have to make an uncomfortable alliance with the anti-European right?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) I think such an alliance would be impossible in post-Lisbon EU too. The anti-European right tends to combine their act to anti-immigration as well in many cases, and very aggressively. I think with the current economic crisis there is an increased risk that the political right, even neofascism, could gain as people look for some way to express their frustration.
 ((WN)) So to wrap up, then: what's the best thing the next European Parliament can do, and what's the best thing you could do in the next European Parliament?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) I think the best thing would be to recognise different opinions. The Parliament is very keen to restrict other voices and likes to pretend were are all one happy family. That is not politics at all.
 What I could do and want to do is to speak and try to fix problems with rights; they have not been properly dealt with in the EU, whether they are workers' rights or for example net users' rights. The fundamental problem with for example the telecoms package is that its staring point is not users' rights, defining them and then going into other stuff. Instead, the starting point is the interests of industry, and the limiting of users via different methods in order to protect certain copyright interpretations. The result then for the user is a collection of random and often illogical ""rights"". The net is something most politicians seem to be unable to handle as a normal and social part of life for millions and millions of people.
 ((WN)) So where should net rights come from — from free speech rights, from privacy rights, from practical considerations of restricting the movement of information?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) From all of those. Mostly you tend to be in a situation, where you have to explain it to politicians that you cannot cut someone's connection (to for example bank services and other daily things) without a court order in copyright cases.
 ((WN)) How do you feel about movements like Sweden's Pirate Party, which is a single-issue group pursuing radical copyright reform?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) Very neutral.
 ((WN)) Anything else you'd like to tell the readers?
 ((Anna Mikkola)) It's been a pleasure. This is actually my second interview online, sort of. The first was earlier this week when I spent two hours on an anti-immigration forum answering questions. I must say you have been very friendly in your questions compared to that.
 ((WN)) Well, thanks for that. It's been a pleasure and thank you for taking the time out for this.
 ((Anna Mikkola)) Thank you, and now I have to run to my next event!

"," Marco Pannella, a member of the European Parliament (MP) and leader of the Nonviolent Radical Party, started a thirst and hunger strike to protest the death sentence against former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
 ""The Iraqi government would commit a horrible act, of the same level as those committed by Saddam Hussein himself,"" Pannella said yesterday in a statement on the party's Web site.
 Granting clemency to the former Iraqi leader would be ""an extraordinary occasion, to make literally explode in the hearth of the Middle East and in the world, an immense act of peace and a debate among the peoples and consciences, the scandal of nonviolence as an alternative to dictatorships and to the war; a war that now, more than ever, is impending on humanity"".
 ""In 2003"", he said, ""despite the vote by a large majority of the Italian Parliament calling for the exile of Saddam Hussein as an alternative to the war, and for a free Iraq, both the Italian Government and the parliamentary opposition, did not follow up to that vital decision. Saddam Hussein was aware of our initiative. He could remember it now with gratitude and regret for not accepting it. A living Saddam Hussein, could become an essential and unique instrument to pacify and deligitize the 'army', made up of gangs of assassins, which is continuously committing massacres against the Iraqi people"".
 Marco Pannella, aged 76, has been at the forefront in Italy of the promotion of important reforms regarding narcotics, facing incarceration on various occasions for his civil disobediences.

"," Cardiff, Wales —
Labour, Plaid Cymru, and No2EU candidates for the Wales seats in the European Parliament met at Cardiff's Sandringham Hotel last night for the second of two pre-election hustings debates hosted by Cardiff Trades Union Congress. Cardiff TUC president Katrine Williams moderated as Derek Vaughan of the Labour Party, Jill Evans MEP of Plaid Cymru, and Rob Griffiths of the No2EU coalition, the tops of their respective lists, took questions from an audience of 22 composed largely of socialist activists and trade union members.
 Candidates from the Tories, Liberal Democrats, and Green Party were not invited to the evening debate, although the Liberal Democrats did take part in the TUC's debate earlier in the day. Ms Williams explained that the Liberal Democrats and Tories had been excluded because ""we wanted to have candidates more representative of trade unions"" but that not inviting the Greens had been ""an oversight"" due to the less prominent tradition of green politics in Wales. The BNP, UKIP and some minor parties also did not take part.
 In opening statements, the three candidates discussed their records and their goals for the European Parliament. Mr Vaughan, leader of Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council, asserted the pro-organised labour credentials of the Labour Party, which has been under fire for several years from the left, and noted that Labour, which currently controls two of Wales's four seats in the EU Parliament, has brought £1.5 billion to Wales, with a comparable amount to come in the future. Calling the BNP ""Nazis"" and comparing the British political situation to that in Germany in the 1930s, Vaughan called for the parties of the left to rally behind Labour in order to ensure that the BNP did not obtain any seats in Wales; but he expressed resignation to the likelihood that the BNP would earn a seat in North West England.
 Ms Evans, meanwhile, who has been an MEP for ten years, announced her opposition to the pro-privatisation current in the EU and pledged that Plaid would support a new program of public investment and pro-organised labour revisions of EU directives, particularly the Posted Workers Directive.
 Mr Griffiths, meanwhile, who is General Secretary of the Communist Party of Britain, took a position urging radical reform of the European Union. The Lisbon Treaty, which he characterised as a re-branding of the European Constitution, would, he argued, enshrine neo-liberal policies in Europe and impose them on its member states in a way that was irreversible — ""at least by any constitutional means"". Calling for a ""social Europe"" as opposed to a ""United States of Europe"", Griffiths suggested that the creation of a European Defence Agency and the actions of the European Court of Justice were being used to turn the European Union into a capitalist ""empire"" akin to the United States.
 Discussion of the ongoing UK parliamentary expenses scandal and its implications for MEPs, who draw salaries and expenses considerably higher than Westminster MPs do, dominated the early discussion. The Labour candidate expressed the position that the problems in accountability leading to the scandal had been fixed; his opponents noted that of the parties currently representing Britain in Brussels, only Labour has not yet disclosed their expenses (although Mr Vaughan states that the party will begin to do so soon) and Mr Griffiths furthermore declared that the scandal was part of a wider problem: the corruption of the political system by big business.
 On the subject of a common European defence policy the three candidates supported widely differing views. The No2EU candidate stated plainly that he considers Europe not to be threatened, and said that a European defence force would be used for foreign adventures in Afghanistan, Africa, and elsewhere in the developing world while at the same time building up the armaments industry in Europe. Ms Evans, meanwhile, argued that the proper role of a common EU force would be as a ""civil force"" supporting conflict prevention and conflict resolution operations, and also called for the abolition of NATO. Mr Vaughan finished the second round of questioning arguing that a common European armed force should be an alternative to the ""US-dominated"" NATO, but also stated the importance of bilateral alliances in building up a common European defence force, citing the Franco-German Brigade of the Eurocorps as an example.
 Debate ended on the contentious question of MEP salaries, with one member of the audience challenging the three candidates to pledge to accept a wage, if they won, equal to the average wage of their constituents. Ms Evans agreed that the set wage, currently £63,000 rising to £73,000 in 2010, was ""too high"", but would not commit to a so-called ""worker's wage"", under heavy criticism from the audience. Mr Vaughan, following, called it ""not fair"" to ask MEPs to take such a pledge but asserted ""I have never been motivated by money"" and finished his part in the debate with a call to elect more left-wing socialist MEPs. Mr Griffiths, whose No2EU coalition has made a worker's wage for MEPs part of their election manifesto, readily pledged to hold to a living wage, albeit not necessarily one equal to the average wage of his constituents, and described some of the difficulties associated with refusing an EU salary, noting that initially No2EU had proposed that its MEPs should draw no salary and claim no expenses from Europe but the coalition's legal advisors had said that to do so would endanger the status of any of its members as MEPs.
 Voting for the European Parliament elections in the United Kingdom takes place June 4.

 At the last general election in 2010, Liberal Democrats won with 46.5% of the vote, holding a 3,864-vote majority over the Conservative Party, who gained 39.3%, and the constituency has been in the Liberal Democrats' control since another by-election in 1994. The party's share of the vote dropped by 14.4 percentage points as UKIP posted their best-ever election results. 
 UKIP leader Nigel Farage has said that after their success in the by-election they will ""take the tremor that [they] have created at Eastleigh and turn it into a national political earthquake"" in the European Parliament election in 2014. Farage said of Prime Minister David Cameron, ""He's talking about gay marriage, wind turbines, unlimited immigration from India. He wants Turkey to join the European Union. The Conservatives' problems are not because of UKIP, it's because of their leader"".
 Grant Shapps, the Conservative Party chairman, said ""We'll be fighting the next election providing a clear choice between David Cameron as PM or [Labour Party leader] Ed Miliband."" David Cameron played down suggestions that UKIP pose a big threat to the Conservative Party at the 2015 General Election. He said, ""It is a disappointing result for the Conservative Party, but it is clear that, in mid-term by-elections, people want to register a protest"". 
 The Labour candidate John O'Farrell ended up fourth with 9.82% of the vote. Ed Miliband responded by saying, ""Clearly I would have preferred to get more votes but this was always going to be a tough fight for Labour"". 
 Chris Huhne, the former Secretary of State for Energy, triggered the election when he resigned as the MP after admitting perverting the course of justice by asking his wife to take speeding penalty points for him in 2003.

"," The European Commission currently has proposals on the table to extend performers' copyright terms. Described by Professor Martin Kretschmer as the ""Beatles Extension Act"", the proposed measure would extend copyright from 50 to 95 years after recording. A vast number of classical tracks are at stake; the copyright on recordings from the fifties and early sixties is nearing its expiration date, after which it would normally enter the public domain or become 'public property'. E.U. Commissioner for the Internal Market and Services Charlie McCreevy is proposing this extension, and if the other relevant Directorate Generales (Information Society, Consumers, Culture, Trade, Competition, etc.) agree with the proposal, it will be sent to the European Parliament.
 Wikinews contacted Erik Josefsson, European Affairs Coordinator for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (E.F.F.), who invited us to Brussels, the heart of E.U. policy making, to discuss this new proposal and its implications. Expecting an office interview, we arrived to discover that the event was a party and meetup conveniently coinciding with FOSDEM 2008 (the Free and Open source Software Developers' European Meeting). The meetup was in a sprawling city centre apartment festooned with E.F.F. flags and looked to be a party that would go on into the early hours of the morning with copious food and drink on tap. As more people showed up for the event it turned out that it was a truly international crowd, with guests from all over Europe.
 Eddan Katz, the new International Affairs Director of the E.F.F., had come over from the U.S. to connect to the European E.F.F. network, and he gladly took part in our interview. Eddan Katz explained that the Electronic Frontier Foundation is ""A non-profit organisation working to protect civil liberties and freedoms online. The E.F.F. has fought for information privacy rights online, in relation to both the government and companies who, with insufficient transparency, collect, aggregate and make abuse of information about individuals."" Another major focus of their advocacy is intellectual property, said Eddan: ""The E.F.F. represents what would be the public interest, those parts of society that don't have a concentration of power, that the private interests do have in terms of lobbying.""
 Becky Hogge, Executive Director of the U.K.'s Open Rights Group (O.R.G.), joined our discussion as well. ""The goals of the Open Rights Group are very simple: we speak up whenever we see civil, consumer or human rights being affected by the poor implementation or the poor regulation of new technologies,"" Becky summarised. ""In that sense, people call us -I mean the E.F.F. has been around, in internet years, since the beginning of time- but the Open Rights Group is often called the British E.F.F.""
 Becky explained to us that she was in Brussels to gather support for a European movement against this proposal. She pointed out to us that compelling economic evidence shows that this measure will not help the E.U. single market, and she hopes that other Directorates will oppose it once they get wind of this fact. We asked Becky Hogge to tell us about the new proposal and why she thinks it is not a good idea. 
 We raised the point that many common people also see copyright as a good thing and something that supports artists, while copyright violation has been said to have led to huge financial losses for the music industry.
 We also noted that the term public domain seems to have a more profound meaning in the United States, and that many Europeans don't even know the term.
 We asked Becky Hogge to tell us the history behind this proposal from a U.K. perspective.
 Erik admitted he was disappointed when he compared the way laws are currently made in the European Union to his experience with Swedish politics.

"," Scores of people have been killed, and many more wounded, in what appear to have been coordinated attacks by gunmen wielding automatic weapons and hand grenades. The attacks began around 10:30 p.m. IST in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.
 Police reports indicate at least 80 deaths and a further 900 injured. More conservative estimates place the death toll at 78 with over 200 injured. Among the dead is believed to be Anti Terrorist Squad chief Hemant Karkare.
 According to television reports, a little-known group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen has claimed responsibility. The name may refer to the Deccan Plateau, which makes up the majority of southern India.
 Sites of the attacks have been listed as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, a hospital, a police station and at least three hotels, including Oberoi Trident and Taj Mahal Palace & Tower. The Marriott Hotel in Juhu has been attacked with gunfire, but details are sketchy. A restaurant, Leopold Cafe on Colaba Causeway was also attacked. Other locations are the Cama Hospital.
 The Taj Mahal and the Oberoi Trident hotels have been surrounded by Indian Rapid Action Force commandos. Gunmen are reported to be holding dozens of hostages, including foreigners, at those locations.
 A fire is reported to be spreading through the Taj Mahal hotel.  The cause is unknown.
 There were hostages at Nariman House in Colaba. This situation has continued all night.
 The government has already blamed the attacks on terrorist organizations sponsored by foreign powers.
 A number of European Parliament Committee on International Trade delegates were staying in the Taj Mahal hotel when it was attacked. One British MEP, Syed Kamall, left the hotel shortly before the attack to go to a restaurant. Another British MEP, Sajjad Karim, was in the lobby when gunmen initially opened fire there, and was last heard of in hiding in the building; also in hiding was German MEP Erika Mann. Polish MEP Jan Masiel was thought to have been sleeping in his hotel room when the attacks occurred and has not been heard from since, and a Hungarian MEP's assistant was reported shot. Also reported as staying at the hotel, and possibly in danger, is Spanish MEP Ignasi Guardans Cambó.

"," In the wake of Tuesday's high-school attack by the Pakistani Taliban (TTK) on an army public school, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced a three-day period of official mourning. In addition to condemnation from world leaders — who include UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz, and Deputy director David Griffiths of Amnesty International — news agency Reuters are reporting the Afghan Taliban have also issued a statement condemning the attack.
 The statement carried by Reuters, claiming to be from Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, reads: ""The intentional killing of innocent people, children and women are against the basics of Islam and this criteria has to be considered by every Islamic party and government."" Tuesday's attack on the Army Public School in Pakistan's north-western city of Peshawar claimed the lives of 132 children, and nine staff from the school.
 Official reports, following police and military action against the attackers, insist seven people took part in the school attack; although a statement, issued by the TTK, insists there were only six, their targets being older pupils. The attack began in the mid morning local time, with the assailants observed entering the compound wearing suicide vests. Shortly thereafter, shots were heard with survivors reporting the gunmen were shooting people indiscriminately, going from classroom to classroom, killing teachers and students as they found them.
 The massacre sparked a public outcry, both national and international; which, press speculate, led to the TTK stressing the intent to only target older students at the army school.
 Turkey announced one day of national mourning. Described as impossible to justify and ""blood-curdling"" by the UN Secretary-General, EU Parliamentary President Schulz labelled the attack ""abominable and cowardly [demonstrating] the inhuman attitude of the Taliban, their inhuman ideology, their remorseless fanaticism"", and Indian Nobel Prize-winner Kailash Satyarthi, condemned the attackers as ""enemies of Allah"" and stated:  ""The militants, be they Taliban or any other militants, who kill children, are the enemies of humanity. This attack is a blot on humanity"".
 In addition to a three-day period of national mourning, President Sharif reintroduced Pakistan's death penalty.

"," Between nine and nineteen Free Gaza Movement activists died today in international waters when Israeli Defense Force commandos boarded vessels attempting to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza. 
 Benjamin Netanyahu gave the death toll to be at least 10. Israeli television says that 19 people were killed and 36 were wounded in the confrontation. 
 The six vessels, called the Gaza Freedom Flotilla, were carrying 10,000 tonnes of humanitarian aid destined for the Gaza Strip, including water purifiers, prefabricated homes and medical equipment. Passengers include several European members of parliament and MPs from Germany, Belgium, Algeria and Israel. 
 Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said that  ""the organizers are well-known for their ties with global jihad, al-Qaida and Hamas. They have a history of arms smuggling and deadly terror."" The Israeli military had declared it would not allow the ships to reach Gaza and said the activists were a ""provocation intended to delegitimise Israel"". The Israeli Navy had been transmitting messages throughout the night ordering them to turn back, stating: ""If you ignore this order and enter the blockaded area, the Israeli navy will be forced to take all the necessary measures in order to enforce this blockade,"" and that the Gaza region was a protected military zone. 
 Huwaida Arraf, one of the organizers, had said that the flotilla was ""fully prepared for the different scenarios"" that might arise, and organizers were hopeful that Israeli authorities would ""do what's right"" and not stop the convoy. She said, ""we fully intend to go to Gaza regardless of any intimidation of threats of violence against us,"" and that ""they are going to have to forcefully stop us."" 
 The pre-dawn boarding took place in international waters around 150 kilometres (90 miles) off the coast of Gaza. Footage from on the flotilla's lead vessel, the MV Mavi Marmara, and video released by the IDF, showed armed Israeli commandos boarding the ship from helicopters and fighting with activists. According to the Israel Defense Forces, the activists attacked the commandos with batons, knives and axes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said;
 A spokesman for the flotilla, Greta Berlin accused Israeli troops of indiscriminately shooting at ""unarmed civilians"". Israel said troops found weapons aboard the Gaza flotilla which were used against the IDF. The allegations were rejected by both the Free Gaza Movement, IHH and Egypt's foreign minister, who said the boats had been searched before they left port. 
 Secretary-General  of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon said he was ""shocked by reports of killings and injuries of people on boats carrying supplies for Gaza"" and called for ""a full investigation to determine exactly how this bloodshed took place"" and urged Israel to ""urgently provide a full explanation"". Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called for three days of mourning to commemorate what he called the ""massacre"" of protesters. Ismail Haniya, the Hamas leader in Gaza, has dubbed the Israeli action as ""a crime"". 
 Turkey's prime minister describes Israeli raid as 'state terrorism' and said Israel violated international laws. Some of the ships were sailing under Turkish flags and media reports indicate that Turkish nationals are among the dead. Turkey demanded an ""urgent explanation"" from Israel and  warned of ""irreparable consequences"" after the incident. Netanyahu said the raid was self defense. Turkey is withdrawing its ambassador to Israel and is calling on the U.N. Security Council to convene in an emergency session about Israel.
 The European Union's foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, has called on Israeli authorities to launch a ""full inquiry"" into the killing. She ""reiterates the European Union's position regarding Gaza - the continued policy of closure is unacceptable and politically counterproductive."" Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said he was ""deeply concerned"" and France said ""nothing can justify"" the incident. Sweden, Austria, Greece and Spain have said it was important to ""quickly establish"" what happened, and have summoned the Israeli ambassadors.
 The British Foreign Secretary William Hague has called on the Government of Israel to open all crossings for aid to enter Gaza and said Israel should ""address the serious concerns about the deterioration in the humanitarian and economic situation and about the effect on a generation of young Palestinians‪."" Russia calls attention to the fact that the Israeli interception of a Gaza-bound international aid flotilla took place in international waters, which it said represents a gross violation of international law.
 European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek has urged the international Middle East mediators Russia, the United States, the United Nations and the European Union to persuade Israel to end its blockade of Gaza. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Europe. In Greece and France there was clashes with police. There were protests in cities around the Ireland, UK and Italy. In the Middle East there were protests in Turkey, Lebanon and Iran.
 The White House said that the United States ""deeply regrets"" the loss of life and injuries and was working to understand the circumstances surrounding this ""tragedy"". The Organization of the Islamic Conference, comprising of 57 countries, described the flotilla incident as ""a serious escalation and a flagrant violation of the international law and human values."" 
 The media has not been given access to the politicians, activists and journalists who were in the convoy or information about deaths and injuries. Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld police say it will deport the roughly 50 of the 671 activists in the flotilla except those who refuse to cooperate. The other activists have been sent to jail in the southern desert town of Beersheba after refusing to identify themselves and will remain in detention. 
 Irishman Dennis Halliday, a former assistant secretary general of the United Nations and the Northern Irish Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Mairead Corrigan Maguire, are aboard the only boat left in the convoy, the Irish MV Rachel Corrie vessel, named after Rachel Corrie. The vessel is now on the way to the Gaza Strip. The Irish Prime Minister Mr Cowen said he believed Israel’s blockade of humanitarian assistance to Gaza was illegal under international law.

"," U.S. officials last night said Osama bin Laden, the al-Qaeda leader and orchestrator of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and embassy bombings in 1998, had been killed by U.S. special forces in Abbottabad, Pakistan near the capital Islamabad.
 White House officials say that four others were killed in the forty-minute raid that began at 2000 UTC yesterday—including a woman said to have been used as a human shield. One of those shot is thought to be bin Laden's son. An American helicopter was lost due to mechanical failure, but no U.S. forces or civilians were killed.
 U.S. President Barack Obama announced the news in a statement late last night. ""I can report to the American people and to the world, that the U.S. has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden,"" Obama said. He confirmed he had been told in August of a lead to the location of bin Laden, and approved the operation last week. The operation involved a ""small team of Americans"", Obama said.
 The operation, led by the CIA, occurred nearly ten years after the 9/11 attacks. CIA director Leon Panetta notified U.S. legislators Sunday about the news. His body was verified using several methods, including DNA testing with DNA from a dead sister's body, stored in a Boston, Massachusetts hospital, as well as facial recognition. However, staff at the hospital in question—Massachusetts General Hospital—have not been able to ""find any evidence"" of the body ever being stored there. U.S. officials said his body was then buried at sea at around 0600 UTC today, ""in accordance with Islamic law and traditions"" and because of the difficulty of finding a country that would accept the remains of the world's most wanted man. Saudi Arabia, the country in which Osama bin Laden was born, refused a U.S. offer to take the body.
 Following the President's announcement, people started gathering in front of the White House in Washington, D.C., Times Square and Ground Zero—the site of the World Trade Center—in New York, to celebrate; singing the national anthem. Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York City, said he hoped the death of bin Laden would ""bring some closure and comfort to all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001"".
 The U.S. government is reportedly expecting al-Qaeda to soon release what they are likely to call a ""martyr tape""—an audio recording made by bin Laden to be broadcast after his death.
 Although the death of the 54-year-old bin Laden, who was the most wanted person in the world, was greeted with celebration in the U.S., analysts have warned that al-Qaeda will ""undoubtedly"" launch a retaliatory attack. ""I think the significance of what has happened cannot really be overstated,"" John Gearson, director of the Centre for Defence Studies at King's College London, said. 
 ""There will be concerns that there could be some sort of retaliation, that al-Qaeda may well want to demonstrate that they are still strong and still in the game."" He warned that U.S. officials may ""lose their focus"" after such a major victory, ""and that will provide an opportunity for the remnants of al-Qaeda to reform and grow stronger.""
 Hillary Clinton, the U.S. Secretary of State, appealed to Islamic militant fighters to use the opportunity of bin Laden's death to abandon their groups. ""Our message to the Taliban remains the same, but today it may have even greater resonance: you cannot wait us out,"" she said. ""You cannot defeat us. But you can make the choice to abandon Al Qaeda and cooperate in a peaceful political process.""
 The president of the European Parliament, Jerzy Buzek, said that ""we have waken up in a safer world"", with the news bringing ""safety to millions of people"", whilst U.S. senator John McCain sought to remind the American people to ""be mindful that al-Qaeda and its terrorist allies are still lethal and determined enemies"". The Kremlin reiterated that ""revenge is inescapable for all terrorists"", and that ""only a joint struggle against global terrorism can bring a result"".
 The United Kingdom's Foreign Secretary, William Hague, sought to remind people bin Laden was ""the world's most prominent leader"", going on to say that ""it was of great importance that he was still alive and active, and it is unequivocally a good thing that he is no longer able to pursue terror, murder and mayhem in the world"". Mentioning that security at British embassies worldwide have been increased in the wake of the news, he reiterated that the death of the al-Qaeda leader was a ""serious blow"", and that, ""like any organisation that has suffered a serious blow, they will want to show in some way that they are still able to operate"".
 Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, welcomed the news, along with many other European countries. He praised the ""tenacity"" of the U.S. attack, congratulating the ""major blow"" the move dealt to al-Qaeda. Eight French citizens were killed last week in a bomb blast in Marrakesh, and, although no group has yet claimed responsibility, it is speculated that al-Qaeda were behind the attack. Sarkozy paid homage to them, as well as other around the world, saying the ""victims received justice today and France has thoughts for them and their families"".
 Pakistani officials were not informed of the planned raid, with the White House saying this was ""essential to the security of the operation and our personnel"". However Obama emphasised that cooperation with Pakistan had helped in finding bin Laden. The operation, described by one senior White House official as ""a surgical raid by a small team designed to minimise collateral damage"", was not intended to take bin Laden alive. ""It was a kill mission"", said one security official. Bin Laden died after being shot in the head.
 Witnesses in Abbottabad have described how the U.S. forces carried out the raid on the compound, which had significant security features, including walls up to 18-foot high topped with barbed wire. ""We saw four helicopters at around 2am. We were told to switch off lights of our homes and stay inside,"" one witness, who lives in the town of Bilal in Abbottabad, said. The man 
confirmed he had seen the wreckage of the U.S. military helicopter which crashed after experiencing mechanical difficulties. 
 Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that the U.S. ""operation was conducted [by] U.S. forces in accordance with declared U.S. policy that Osama bin Laden will be eliminated in a direct action by the U.S. forces, wherever found in the world"", noting that almost ""30,000 Pakistani civilians"" had been killed in terrorist attacks in recent years, with the ""nation fully united in [its] resolve to eliminate terrorism"".
 However, Pervez Musharraf, a former president of Pakistan, criticised the U.S. involvement, describing the operation as a ""violation of [Pakistani] sovereignty,"" and saying the raid was a ""a failure of both Pakistani and U.S. intelligence""; he stressed it would have been ""far better"" if the Pakistani Special Services Group had carried out the attack. Musharraf went on to say he was ""surprised"" bin Laden was found in Abbottabad, but added the terrorist leader ""had declared war against Pakistan"", and that the news came as a ""victory for the people of Pakistan and all the peace loving people of the world"".
 The news that bin Laden was hiding just a few hundred metres from Pakistan Military Academy, a similar institution to the U.S. West Point Academy or the UK Sandhurst, has been met with embarrassment on behalf of the Pakistani government, and scepticism from others. ""This is a serious blow to the credibility of Pakistan"", according to one Pakistani security analyst. Earlier today, Afghanistan president Hamid Karzai maintained he knew bin Laden was in Pakistan: ""For 10 years we told NATO and the world community but for ten years they didn't listen to our voice. They burned Afghanistan for ten years but Osama was in Islamabad.""
 Whilst many governments worldwide welcomed the death of bin Laden, more than 800 people marched in the Pakistani city of Quetta, paying homage to bin Laden and burning a U.S. flag. According to the organizer, ""Bin Laden was the hero of the Muslim world and after his martyrdom he has won the title of great mujahed"". At the march, pro-Taliban and anti-United States sentiments were chanted, before the protesters dispersed peacefully.
 Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan have denied that bin Laden has been killed, although in a conference call to several Pakistani media outlets, a rebel spoksperson threatened to seek revenge: ""If Bin Laden attained martyrdom, then we will avenge his death and we will attack the governments of Pakistan and the United States and their security forces"".
 Although no images of bin Laden's body have been released, the Obama administration is, according to ABC News, in possession of gruesome photographs: a ""massive head wound"" where he took a bullet, with ""blood and brains clearly visible"".
 The price of oil has dropped following the announcement after speculation that the death of bin Laden will lower the risk of supply disruption in the Middle East, with a barrel of crude oil for June delivery falling by $1.92.

"," President Bush today confirmed that the CIA has held up to 100 terrorism suspects in secret overseas prisons. Speaking in a televised announcement, he said the CIA no longer held any prisoners and was disclosing information on the men's detention because the interrogation was complete. 14 of the men have been moved from  CIA custody to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
 Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, is thought to be among 14 suspects moved, including Ramzi Binalshibh and Abu Zubaydah.
 President Bush said that the CIA interrogations had been vital in tracking down and capturing further suspects; such as Mohammed. He denied that the men were tortured: ""The US does not torture. I have not authorised it and I will not."" Despite the frank disclosure the President would not confirm exactly where the secret prisons had been located, although last year The Washington Post reported on the possible existence of detention centers in Eastern Europe causing deep concern in the EU. The European Parliament also protested against so called 'rendition' flights across Europe to transport prisoners to the secret centers.
 The announcement comes a month after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the use of military commissions to try detainees was illegal. The president's proposal will help lay the groundwork for congressional legislation proposals, that if approved, would establish a legal basis for allowing military tribunal hearings of some prisoners held in the Cuban base. Mr Bush, speaking alongside family members of 9/11 victims, said it was now up to Congress to authorize the commissions so that, ""the men our intelligence officials believe orchestrated the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001, can face justice."" The new policy is more like a military tribunal than the previous proposals.
 The president said he would submit the legislation today for consideration. It is reportedly causing controversy on Capitol Hill leaving Bush facing a potential rebellion from his own party, something he will be keen to avoid with his mid-term elections approaching. A spokesman for the Senate subcommittee that will consider the bill said there were ""some sticking points with the administration"" over the exact content.
 A major part of the bill marks a role reversal by the Pentagon; previously the administration had argued that many of the detainees were ""illegal combatants"" and so not subject to the Geneva convention. The military commissions will now cover all Guantanamo Bay suspects with the convention, which, among other things, expressly forbids the use of torture. The president said that the bill would also ensure that individual US soldiers could not be sued by detainees in US courts.
 The announcements coincide with a renewed focus on terrorism by Bush's Republican administration and comes as the party faces a tough mid-term election later this year.
 The president concluded that the interrogation program had helped to prevent terrorism in America: ""Were it not for this program, our intelligence community believes that al Qaeda and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against the American homeland. By giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhere else, this program has saved innocent lives.""

114," Wednesday, December 2, 2009 "," Religious and political leaders from around the world have criticised the ban on building minarets as part of the Swiss referendum held in November.
 Leaders from the Vatican and the Muslim community around the world have deplored the vote as an attack on religious freedom. The Swiss government has also expressed shame at the result, and expects repercussions from Muslim countries with which it does business. Some politicians from other countries, however, defended the ban.
 The co-president of the European Greens-European Free Alliance in the European Parliament, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, has already called upon Muslims to withdraw their funds from Swiss banks, echoed by warnings from Turkish State Minister Egemen Bagis, chief negotiator in European Union accession talks, who said in an interview with the Hürriyet that ""I am certain this [the vote] will prompt our brothers from Muslim countries who keep their money and investments in Swiss banks to review their decision,"" he said.
 France's Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that the ban revealed ""intolerance"" and called for it to be reversed. ""If you are not allowed to build minarets, that means that religion is being oppressed,"" he said.
 Reaction from some Muslim leaders was even stronger. ""This is the hatred of Swiss people against Muslim communities. They do not want to see a Muslim presence in their country and this intense dislike has made them intolerant,"" said Maskuri Abdillah, head of Indonesia's largest Muslim group, Nahdlatul Ulama.
 Egypt's Grand Mufti Ali Gomaa called the ban an insult to all Muslims. ""This proposal […] is not considered just an attack on freedom of beliefs, but also an attempt to insult the feelings of the Muslim community in and outside Switzerland,"" he said
 The Swiss Government—which had opposed the vote—attempted to reassure Muslims that ""this is not a rejection of the Muslim community, religion or culture,"" with the Conference of Swiss Bishops saying that it ""heightens the problems of cohabitation between religions and cultures.""
 Amnesty International, along with other rights organisations, stated that the result of the vote meant that religious freedom, as codified in the European Convention on Human Rights, was no longer ensured, and the Swiss Green Party is considering bringing the matter up at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
 Reaction from France and Germany was more nuanced, with the French leading political party's spokesman Xavier Bertrand saying that he was ""not sure that minarets are needed in order to practise Islam in France"", and Germany's Wolfgang Bosbach calling criticism unconstructive; he said that there was fear of Islamisation ""and this fear must be taken seriously.""
 Some right-wing groups in France, Austria, Italy and the Netherlands called the vote a success of the people against the elite and for other countries to undertake similar steps. France's National Front said that the ""elites should stop denying the aspirations and fears of the European people, who, without opposing religious freedom, reject ostentatious signs that political-religious Muslim groups want to impose,"" with Italy's Northern League adding ""Switzerland is sending us a clear signal: yes to bell towers, no to minarets.""

"," The Romanian Humanist Party has voted to change its name to the Conservative Party (Partidul Conservator, or PC). During its congress, a resolution was also passed for the party to join the European People's Party-European Democrats group in the European Parliament.
 Dan Voiculescu suggested the change of name, blaming the party's moderate doctrine for its poor election results. Voiculescu said he studied several political doctrines and has found that the Humanist ideology has much in common with the Conservative ideology, including an emphasis on free market economics as a key means of achieving social welfare. Other elements of the Conservative Party's ideology include a reduction in state intervention in the economy and private property, as well as the importance of traditional values such as the family, army and church, and national values and ethics. The party's new slogan is ""Make a stand, Romanian!""
 The Conservative Party is currently part of the Justice and Truth governing coalition, even though it is generally regarded as the most controversial party in the coalition. This is because its policies and stance on key issues are generally against that of the other coalition parties, especially the National Liberal Party and the Democratic Party. For example, the Humanist Party was the only party in the governing coalition to call for the withdrawal of troops from Iraq, and it has been accused of allying with whatever party is in power, regardless of its ideology.

"," The President of Romania, Traian Băsescu, met yesterday with Jonathan Scheele, the head of the European Commission's Delegation to Bucharest, as well as with several European parliamentarians (MEPs). The parties discussed Romania's accession to the EU, which is particularly important as the Accession Treaty is scheduled to be signed late this month, after being voted on by the European Parliament on April 13.
 Băsescu told the delegation that European integration remains Romania's first priority at the moment, and that after negotiations were closed with the EU in December 2004, accession became a matter of internal politics rather than foreign affairs.
 The MEPs talked to Băsescu about public opinion regarding EU accession in Romania, as well as the impact of accession on the rural population. Judging from recent polls, the overwhelming majority of Romania's population approve EU accession, even though this may be partly due to the fact that many of them have not been adequately informed of the costs of accession. The parliamentarians also discussed the environment and the situation in neighbouring countries, especially Moldova. Tourism was also discussed in the context of promoting Romania's image to European Union citizens.
 The delegation also discussed with Băsescu a key issue in Romania's accession process: judicial reform. The Romanian President told the MEPs that Romania has taken bold steps to reform its judiciary and fight corruption. There is also progress towards forming an anti-corruption department within the Internal Ministry of Romania.
 As part of Romania's foreign policy, Băsescu also said that, once a member of the European Union, Romania would act as an advocate for other Southeastern European states wishing to join the organisation, as well as seeking to attract public attention to the broader Black Sea region. Romania and Bulgariaare the most advanced countries in Southeastern Europe in terms of EU integration, and will therefore be the first countries in this region to join the 25-nation bloc.

"," 
The president of Romania, Traian Băsescu, announced today that he would call a referendum next year asking Romanians whether they approve the switch to a unicameral legislature. 
 Romania currently has a bicameral parliamentary structure, similar to the United Kingdom and United States, with a Chamber of Deputies as the lower house and a Senate as the upper house. In the past month, however, President Băsescu has stated that he would like to see the replacement of the current system with a unicameral parliament, consisting of only one chamber, as well as a reduction in the overall number of parliamentarians. His reason is the functions of the Chamber of Deputies and Senate are nearly identical in Romania, both being elected by the people every five years under the system of proportional representation. These reasons are similar to the ones used when converting the legislature of the U.S. State of Nebraska to a unicameral house.
 The unicameral plan, however, has come under fire from several political parties, including some from the ruling Justice and Truth Alliance. The Prime Minister of Romania, Călin Popescu-Tăriceanu, from the National Liberal Party, does not support the unicameral plan, and neither do the two major opposition parties, the Social Democrats and Great Romania.
 Despite the political opposition, President Băsescu has constantly said that it would be up to the people to decide whether such a reform should take place, and hence announced today that the referendum on this issue would be held next year. The referendum would be held at the same time as the vote to elect Romania's 35 representatives to the European Parliament, as Romania will join the European Union in 2007.

 Soviet human rights activist Yelena Bonner died of heart failure in Boston, Massachusetts on Saturday at the age of 88, her daughter Tatiana Yankelevich said in a statement. She had been hospitalized since February 21.  
 Bonner gained fame by smuggling the papers of her late husband,  the nuclear physicist and Russian dissident Andrei Sakharov, out of Siberia and was prominent in her own right for her human rights activism.  
 Leaders and politicians  paid Bonner tribute. ""The world has lost one of the most inspiring and dedicated human rights defenders,"" said Jerzy Buzek, President of the  European Parliament.
 Bonner was born in  Turkmenistan  February 15, 1923 to a family of Communist Party officials; her father was later killed and her mother sent to a gulag in  Joseph Stalin's purges of the late 1930s. 
 In  1941, she became  a nurse for the Soviet military on the front during World War II. She suffered a severe wound to the chest, and serious head injuries in 1943 from which she nearly lost her sight, and received decorations for valor.  Bonner returned to the front in 1945, advancing with the army to Potsdam. While studying medicine when the war was over, she married a fellow student, Ivan Semyonov and they had a son and a daughter. But as she became increasingly politically active, they lost their common interests and divorced in 1965. 
 She was an active Soviet dissident  in the 1970s, and a leader of a group that monitored Soviet compliance with the Helsinki Accords. The Washington Post describes her at this time as ""[h]eadstrong and sharp-tongued with a no-nonsense voice deepened by years of chain-smoking acrid Russian cigarettes"".
 Bonner married Sakharov in 1972, whom she had met through her political activities. He  was also fierce critic of the lack of civil liberties and human rights in the Soviet Union, and their tiny Moscow apartment became the meeting place for the Soviet dissident movement in the 1970s. They traveled around Russia together visiting imprisoned dissidents and working for their legal rights.
 When Sakharov  won  the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, she traveled to Oslo to receive it on his behalf as Soviet authorities refused to allow her husband to leave the country.
 Sakharove was arrested in 1980 and exiled to  Siberia, and Bonner, Sakharove's sole contact with the outside world, smuggled  his writings to Moscow and ensured that they were published. Soviet authorities conducted campaigns of personal attacks against her, accusing her of being a foreign agent who turned Sakharove against his country. In 1984 she was convicted of ""anti-Soviet agitation"" and was exiled to Siberia with her husband, both continually  harassed by authorities. She published her memoir in 1986 of the years in exile, described by the Washington Post as partly ""a love story of mutual sacrifice.""
 In 1986  Mikhail Gorbachev allowed the Sakharoves to return to Moscow  where they continued to agitate for human rights and were constantly harassed for their activities. 
 When the Soviet Union collapsed two years after  Sakharov's death in 1989, Bonner continued her human rights and  political activities. She initially supported President Boris Yeltsin's government and served on his state human rights commission, but became critical of his government at the beginning of the war in Chechnya. She was also critical of Yeltin's successor, Vladimir  Putin, and was the first person to sign a petition against him in March 2010. 
 As her health deteriorated, she became less active, and she moved to the United States to be with her daughter.
 Bonner received the Rafto Prize in 1991 for her promotion of human rights in the former Soviet Union and in contemporary Russia.  She published at least four books and edited her husband's memoirs which were published in 1997.
 U.S. State Department's spokesperson Victoria Nuland said in a statement: ""We note with profound sadness the death of Yelena Bonner, an extraordinary voice among human rights defenders in the former Soviet Union and the Russian Federation.""

"," The first members of parliament for the British National Party (BNP) were elected today, in the United Kingdom elections for the European Parliament.  Nick Griffin, the leader of the party, was elected Member of the European Parliament in the North West England region, and Andrew Brons was elected in the Yorkshire and the Humber region.  This is the first time that the BNP has won a parliamentary seat in any European Parliamentary or U.K. General Election.
 Although the number of votes cast for the BNP in the North West England region in the 2009 election (132,094) was lower than the number of votes cast for the BNP (134,959) in the previous election in 2004, the percentage of the popular vote achieved by the BNP rose, from 6.4% to 8.0%, because of a lower overall voter turnout. Nick Robinson claimed this was because of the abolition in postal ballots in this years elections. He went on to say that BNP voters are more enthusiastic on voting, so their votes wouldn't decline as much as other parties.
 Similarly, in the Yorkshire and the Humber region, the number of votes cast for the party fell from 126,538 in the 2004 elections to 120,139 in the 2009 elections, but a lower turnout resulted in the party's percentage share in the popular vote rising from 8.0% to 9.8%.
 The BNP will now receive EU funding, in the form of MEP expenses and office and staff allowances.  What it will receive will be governed by the Statute for Members of the European Parliament, new rules for MEP expenses introduced for the newly elected 2009 parliament.  Mr Griffin and Mr Brons will each receive a €7,000 per month salary (formally, 38.5% of the basic salary of a judge at the European Court of Justice), paid from the EU budget, and a pension when they leave office. They will also be entitled to employ personal staff, whose salaries are also paid from the EU budget.
 The election of BNP MEPs has caused protests.  Mr Griffin was accosted by political protestors when he attended the vote counting on the night of June the 7th, and was forced to enter the building via a rear entrance.  When he stepped forward to make his victory speech, after the result had been declared, all other parties' candidates took the unusual step of leaving the stage.

Media attention about a little noticed and month-old U.S. Department of Homeland Security report that international airline travelers in-and-out of the U.S. were being tracked via an Automated Targeting System (ATS) has drawn renewed interest. 
 The database system, started four years ago, accumulates information on overseas travelers and assigns a ""terrorist risk rank"" to each individual. Such information may include nationality, flight patterns, motor vehicle driving records, and so on. Because ATS is exempt from many provisions of the U.S. Privacy Act, travelers cannot view or question their own rating.
 The governmental branch, Customs and Border Patrol, is responsible for administration of the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P).  The ATS-P received $28.3 million in funding this fiscal year, up $2.4 million from the previous year. The additional funding will be used to, ""incorporate additional government and non-government databases for risk analysis utilizing ATS-P's rules based analysis"" according to the Homeland Security 2006 fiscal year report.
 International co-operation sought by the U.S. from European Union member states for information sharing on EU travelers was found to be illegal by the European Court of Justice in June this year. But a previously struck sharing agreement, dating from May 2004 between EU airlines and the U.S. became locked in legal complications. Maneuvering by the European Parliament rendered the court's ruling void.

"," Last week fifty volunteers, from nine countries covering nineteen languages, spent four days at the European Parliament buildings in Strasbourg photographing and filming members of the parliament (MEPs). This being an effort to significantly increase the audio-visual content available in Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects.
 Members of the team, who were all granted guest press accreditation, began arriving at the hotel in the small town of Kork, not far from the France–Germany border, on Saturday. The team base, Hotel Ochsen, has an interesting history. Placards on the courtyard wall explain it served as headquarters for Field marshal Kollowrat-Krakowsky battling Napoleonic forces in the 1796 Siege of Kehl.
 Those arriving later came directly to the Louise Weiss building, which hosts the parliament's plenary sessions and all voting on EU matters. Whilst staying in the hotel, the Wikimedian group met two MEPs who chose it in-preference to dramatically more-expensive Strasbourg accommodation. One of the ushers from the parliament also chatted with volunteers at the hotel, self-depricatingly describing his ceremonial attire as a ""penguin suit"" due to the long-tailed jacket.
 One of the first day's MEPs to introduce themselves to the visiting Wikimedians was Christian Engström; delivering copies of his book, The Case for Copyright Reform, co-authored with  Swedish Pirate Party founder Rickard Falkvinge. Engström explained that, in the book, he argues Wikipedia is one of the losers under current copyright legislation. One of numerous MEPs who recorded video introductions in multiple languages, he was more-confident than some colleagues — the most-challenging taking thirteen takes to successfully record.
 Over 1,000 new, high-quality, photographs were taken and uploaded for use on Wikimedia projects during the visit. The second and third days in the parliament saw the highest number of MEPs coming to see the visiting Wikimedians and have their photographs taken. Once photographed, MEPs were encouraged to make video introductions in languages they were comfortable speaking in. In excess of 200 video clips of MEPs introducing themselves were captured; this providing freely-reusable audio and video records available via Wikimedia Commons. 
 Parliamentarians became more-enthusiastic about the project in its later days, with significantly more turning up to be photographed and filmed. Given some turned up as Wikimedians were packing up on the last day, some still lack freely-licensed photographs for their Wikipedia entries. French MEP, and National Front member, Bruno Gollnisch was amongst those disappointed when turning up after much of the equipment was packed up; although Gollnisch has already provided some video recordings, he had returned with additional prepared texts — including Japanese — for use in a video introduction.
 Despite much of two levels within the parliament set aside for the press, the event received little coverage from mainstream media. France TV's channel three broadcast a report on the  Thursday, making footage available via their website on the Friday.
 In contrast the Voice intro project (WikiVIP) started by Andy Mabbett, and brought to a far-wider audience with Stephen Fry's endorsement, saw Mabbet give an interview from one of the parliament's radio studios with United States' public radio network NPR. With Fry's recording catching the attention of the press, that project has received coverage from as-far afield as Italy, Russia, and Japan.
 Audio for use on Wikipedia is to be extracted from video recordings of MEPs for use on Wikimedia projects. As available storage and bandwidth increases, it is a longer-term goal of the Wikimedia Foundation to increase freely-available, and reusable, multimedia content across all projects hosted by the Foundation.
 The project also served as an opportunity to emphasise that all Wikimedia content is created through people donating their time and effort. Whilst MEPs knew anyone could edit Wikipedia, meeting a group representing all ages, and much of Europe, served as an effective public-relations exercise.

"," The French National Assembly is to adopt a bill, known as DADVSI (« Droits d'Auteurs et Droits Voisins de la Société de l'Information », ""author's right and related rights in the information society""), tomorrow. This bill reforms the French code of intellectual property (CPI) and other laws, mostly in order to implement the 2001 European directive on copyright.
 The directive mandates legal protections of Digital rights management (DRM) measures against circumvention. DRMs are ""digital locks"" that prevent users from freely copying or playing contents, in order to enforce the copyright of the authors, artists, publishers and producers. The initial draft of the bill, proposed by Minister of Culture Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres, made circumvention of DRMs, or even facilitation thereof, a felony (délit), with a maximal penalty of 3 years in prison and/or a €300,000 fine as with counterfeiting. Since DRMs, circumvention and facilitations were not legally defined, it was feared that the law would effectively prevent competitors from creating players, especially based on free software, compatible with major systems such as Apple's iPod or Microsoft's Windows Media Player — or even to prevent the creation of any free software capable of loading files with DRM capabilities, that is, potentially most future text, audio or video file formats.
 The initial draft also conserved the threat of a counterfeiting felony conviction for those exchanging copyrighted files on the Internet. This was judged to be unfairly repressive and unrealistic. In France, it is commonplace for Internet users to have broadband up to 16 megabits per second in cheaply priced (€30 a month or lower) ADSL packages, often comprising VoIP phone and television ; millions of users, especially the young, are believed to use peer-to-peer file sharing software. Lawmakers, from both the majority UMP party and the opposition, found it unwise to turn millions of citizens into potential felons. As a consequence, the Minister proposed a ""gradual"" scheme where mere downloading of one file would be punishable by a €38 fine, which was adopted as an amendment. It remains to be seen how the law will be enforced.
 With respects to DRMs, lawmakers from both the majority UMP party, the centrist Union for French democracy and the opposition adopted amendments that make it compulsory for publishers of DRM-encumbered content to give the specifications to whomever would like to implement a compatible player. This proposal was decried by some US news sources as targeting Apple Computer's iTunes system, tied to the iPod players. It is yet unknown, though, if these amendments would apply to companies that choose not to claim the new special protection awarded to DRMs by the law, which enable them to sue those who implement software meant to circumvent their protections.
 Lawmakers also expressed concerns that the proposed law would weaken existing legal exceptions to copyright, especially the right for users to make copies of copyrighted files for private use (CPI L122-5).
 The lawmaking process was quite a bumpy one. In December, lawmakers adopted a surprise amendment that would legalize peer-to-peer sharing as ""private copy"", much to the dismay of the Minister of Culture. The amendment, proposed by a bipartisan coalition of majority UMP and opposition lawmakers, was the first in a series that would have established a system known as the ""global license"" through which Internet users would have paid a flat fee in exchange for an authorization to use peer-to-peer services. The fees collected would be redistributed to authors and performers. In March, the Minister tried to withdraw article 1 of the law, which was the one that was amended to his dislike, but the next day he had to reintroduce it because withdrawing it may have been unconstitutional. The Assembly then voted the article down and adopted an Article 1 ""bis"", essentially an amended version of article 1 without the legalization of peer-to-peer sharing.
 The law, initially presented as an uncontroversial, technical text, soon became a hot topic. Some lawmakers, both from the opposition and the majority, decried intense lobbying by the entertainment industry. Some amendments were nicknamed the ""Vivendi Universal amendment"", from the name of a major entertainment company that some lawmakers and commentators claim has inspired them. UMP lawmakers such as Bernard Carayon denounced pressures and even blackmail from some powerful lobbies.
 The Assembly will very probably adopt the bill on March 21, despite the opposition of some UMP, UDF and opposition lawmakers. The bill will then be sent to the French Senate for further amendment and approval. Since the government declared the bill to be urgent, it is probably that after examination by the Senate, the bill will be sent to a mixed Assembly/Senate commission for harmonization, then finally voted. Given that some UMP and opposition lawmakers have voiced concerns about the constitutionality of some episodes of the lawmaking process, it is likely that the bill will get sent to the Constitutional Council for constitutional review. Finally, president Jacques Chirac is likely to sign it into law.

"," Today, the French National Assembly passed a bill that would penalise what the bill calls negationism of the Armenian Genocide. The French government however opposes the bill; Catherine Colonna, Minister charged with European Affairs, reacted that ""It's the task, first and foremost, of historians and not of lawmakers to clarify history.""
 The label ""genocide"" is disputed by the Turkish government, who has called the vote a ""serious blow"" to diplomatic relations.  Turkey has been known to prosecute Turkish intellectuals who discuss the Armenian genocide, including recent Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk. Under the Turkish Penal Code, ""prosecution for anti-national plots"" faces those who call ""for the recognition of the Armenian genocide"".
 Turkey's Prime Minister Erdoğan had warned France to look into its own colonial past in Africa instead of demanding Turkish recognition of the events. Ali Babacan, the Turkish Minister of Economy, in Brussels for talks on Turkey's E.U.-membership, said he could not exclude that people would start boycotting French products in Turkey. In a recent visit to Armenia, the French President Jacques Chirac launched the idea that recognition as a ""genocide"" would be necessary for Turkey to enter the E.U., causing the media to label it as the ""Chirac criterion"". The European Commission, which has confirmed that such a criterion would not be instituted, deplored the initiative of the French parliament, because it could damage contacts with the European Union.
 Most historians view the events comprising the Armenian genocide as a state-sponsored plan of mass extermination.  Their reasons include various eye witness reports, Turkey's recruitment of violent criminals to posts within the ""Special Organization"", and the sheer number of dead, estimates of which remain as high as 1.5 million. Some politically influential countries like the U.S., Canada, and France have driven efforts to interpret these events as an attempt to eradicate an ethnic group. The Turkish government, as well as a few historians, estimate the number of casualties much lower, and attribute them to inter-ethnic strife, disease and famine during World War I.
 Armenia has congratulated France over its ""natural response"" to an ""aggressive"" policy of ""denial"" by the Turkish government.  Armenians often argue that Turkey's recognition will help prevent similar events in the future. These assertions include claims that Scheubner-Richter's observations of the Armenian genocide had a formative influence upon Hitler's plans for the Jews.
 The French bill provides for a 1-year prison sentence and a € 45,000 fine, the same as for Holocaust denial. It must still be approved by the Senate and the President, and due to the parliamentary calendar, news sources think it is unlikely that it will be discussed before the end of the legislation period in February 2007.

"," The French Parliament passed a law extending the state of emergency decreed on November 8 by president Jacques Chirac for a duration of 3 months, the executive being authorized to terminate this period earlier if necessary. The November 8 decision, based on a 1955 statute, could last for a maximum of 12 days only, after which Parliament had to vote on an extension.
 The state of emergency allows local authorities (prefects) to prohibit public meetings and regulate movements of persons, including curfews. In addition, in certain zones specified by the executive, where riots have recently taken place, local authorities may close meeting halls or bars; detain firearms; and authorize searches inside habitations during the day or the night by administrative order (normally, searches during formal criminal investigations have to be authorized by a judge). The government said that it will not use the power to regulate the media, and that searches will be subject to supervision by the judiciary.
 The law was defended by Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy, in charge of law enforcement. Sarkozy spoke before the French National Assembly (which approved the text on November 15) and the French Senate (which approved it on November 16); he defended the actions of the government and explained why, in his opinion, the law had to be voted. Sarkozy is also the head of the UMP party, which holds a majority in both houses, and there was no doubt that the text would be approved.
 Sarkozy added that in the forthcoming months, CRS (riot division of the Police) and Gendarmerie mobile forces would operate daily in difficult suburbs as a ""proximity police"". He contended that the ""proximity police"" established by preceding left-wing government was too much concerned with social activities and not enough about arresting criminals. Sarkozy has also contended that some of the riots were orchestrated by drug traffickers, gangsters and other criminals in order to secure lawless zones.
 The French Socialist Party opposed the law, claiming it was excessive. Some left-wing members of parliament contended that using a law passed in 1955 to help quashing Algerian independence movements against children of Algerian immigrants was somewhat insensitive and unsuccessfully proposed an amendment to repeal the 1955 law. On the other hand, right-wing anti-immigrant politician Philippe de Villiers has contended that the government was far too soft and called for the use of military force. Jean-Marie Le Pen, a longtime opponent of immigration from poor, Muslim countries, pointed out that the events vindicated what he had long said.
 Members of Sarkozy's UMP party blamed the de facto polygamy of some African immigrants for the failure of their families to raise and educate children properly. They suggested a more restrictive approach to immigration.
 Nicolas Sarkozy is a probable contender for the 2007 presidential election. According to polls, his approval rate jumped by +11 to 63% during the events; he leads the approval opinions for presidential candidates.

 According to him, the president's real budget is approximately three times the budget given for his services in the yearly national budget voted by the French Parliament, because many employees and services are provided by other ministries and public services free of charge to the presidency, and thus are counted in other budgets. As an example, the French Ministry of Defense provides republican guards and other soldiers, as well as aerial transportation; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs funds official foreign trips; and repairs, furnitures etc. to presidential offices are funded by the Ministry of Culture. Mr Dosière reports that in 2003, the total spending was 82.6 million Euros, while the official budget of the presidency was 30.5 million.
 Mr Dosière started inquiring about presidential expenses about four years ago, and since then has been a critic of the opacity of accounting at the presidency. In order to obtain the necessary information, he has had to ask numerous questions to the executive and administrations.
 In addition, he points out that the official budget of the presidency has boomed under Jacques Chirac's term: between 1995 and 2005, it climbed from 5,21 millions to 26,14 millions. In 1995, the president also had at his disposal some ""secret funds"", the total amount of which was voted by parliament, but which could be spent at his discretion. ""Secret funds"" were originally meant to fund specific missions that could not be funded within the exacting rules of public accounting, such as secret operations abroad, but they gradually also came to serve to pay various gratifications to government officials. Since 2002, secret funds have been cut and are reserved for paying for secret operations, while services that used them for normal operations were given special compensation. In 2005, the special compensation for the presidency was 5.5 million Euros.
 In 2001, the French Parliament voted a law known as the LOLF (Loi d'orientation relative aux lois de finances) reforming the budget system, with a timetable for gradual implementation. This law mandates that any public spending should be traced to an identifiable ""mission"" of government.

"," France's upper house voted yesterday to approve a bill to allow same-sex marriage to be legal following protests for and against the bill. The bill also makes it legal for gay couples to adopt children, and is scheduled to return to the lower house next Wednesday.
 The bill is being supported by the ruling Socialist party and by President Hollande, as well as by the Communists and Greens. Hollande's justice minister Christiane Taubira said it would ""move our institutions towards ever more freedom, equality and personal respect"" and would strengthen French society ""by granting the simple recognition of full citizenship to homosexual couples"". The leader of the Socialist party in the Senate, François Rebsamen, welcomed the passage of the bill: ""We are overwhelmed with pride by this vote to move our society forward"". France has civil unions which have been available to both gay and straight couples since 1999.
 Opponents of the bill have held demonstrations in Paris, with an estimated 340,000 people protesting at the Eiffel Tower in January. Supporters of the bill responded by having a march with an estimated 125,000 people in attendance. The gay rights group SOS Homophobie said that they had seen a rise in homophobic attacks recently, claiming that assaults against gay people had risen by 30% since 2011.
 Controversy arose earlier this week as Larousse, publishers of the French dictionary, announced that the 2014 edition of the dictionary would change the listing for 'marriage' to include same sex as well as opposite sex couples. Members of the right wing UMP have responded to the change with outrage, with UMP politician Hervé Mariton calling for a boycott. Larousse noted that the changed the definition based on usage rather than based on the legal status of same sex marriage.

This was the first time since the 1979 revolution that a bill was passed in five minutes. This bill was given double-urgency status, making it a higher priority over everything else. This passage occurs after the UN implemented sanctions against Iran for continuing its nuclear program; the new law permits for Iran to continue its program against the UN's wishes.
 This new law allows President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to take action about the use of nuclear energy in Iran, including establishing conditions of inspections by the UN. However, the bill does not authorize the complete end of inspections.

The designation was backed on Sunday by Iran's Foreign Ministry. Earlier in the week, the U.S. Senate had passed a resolution giving a similar designation to Iran's Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution.

 According to an official from the commission, the Independent High Electoral Commission, a recount was unnecessary because of checks for fraud, as well as being impossible.  Despite these claims, the long interval between the elections and the announcement of official results has led to increasing allegations of fraud and calls for a recount, from both civilians and politicians.  In the city of Najaf, a recent protest demanding a recount drew hundreds of people, some with signs accusing the commission of fraud.
 The commission has had to deal with numerous issues in its count of the votes, including technical problems with the counting system, and mistakes in the counting of votes have led some employees to be fired from the operation.  Despite the problems, it has succeeded in counting around 90% of the votes, and the current results have former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi leading current PM Nouri Maliki by around 8,000 votes, although Maliki's party stood to gain more representation, as it led in seven out of eighteen provinces, and seats in Parliament are allocated based on the outcome of each province.  Final results from the election are expected by the end of March
 Iraqi President Jalal Talabani issued a formal call for a recount, saying that ""I demand the Independent High Electoral Commission recount the ballots manually starting from Sunday, March 21.""  Maliki has also made his support for a recount clear.  Despite the pressure, the commission has said that such a recount ""can't be done,"" while at the same time denying that it was impossible, only very time-consuming, and only results from individual provinces could be recounted.
 Despite claims of fraud in the election, most international observers have been largely supportive of the conduct, although this sentiment is not shared by some Iraqi politicians, including Allawi, who said that the election had been ""grossly mismanaged.""

 The new design no longer has the three green stars of the old flag, as they represented the ideals of the Baath party - ""Unity, Freedom, Socialism"". Saddam Hussein was a leading member of the Baath party before his rule was ended in 2003. 
 The stars had upset many Kurds, who viewed them as a symbol of the régime that had killed thousands of their people. Massoud Barzani, President of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government, banned the flag in his region in 2006.
 ""The new flag has no signs of Saddam's regime and is a sign that change has been achieved in the country"", said Humam Hamoudi, a member of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council.
 The parliament voted 110-50 in favor of the change. They stated the new flag is only temporary, and that they will seek another redesign after a year has passed.
 Parliament speaker Mahmud Mashhadani said the new flag will be flown from ""constitutional and non-constitutional institutions"", as well as in Kurdish regions and Iraqi embassies.
 Some, like Sadrist lawmaker Ahmed al-Masody, opposed the stars' removal. ""We would have announced that they don't symbolize the Baath Party, but other principles, like justice"", al-Masody said. He refers to a different proposal that would have changed the script's color to yellow and made the stars represent ""peace, tolerance and justice"".
 The flag previously went through changes in 2004, when the Arabic inscription ""Allahu Akbar"", meaning ""God is great"", was changed to a stylized Kufic script. The words on the old flag were alleged to be in Saddam Hussein's handwriting.

"," On Saturday, the Iraqi parliament approved a power-sharing agreement, after eight months of negotiations.
 The agreement, reached on Tuesday, appeared to be falling apart on Thursday after the Sunni-backed al-Iraqiya List, led by Ayad Allawi, walked out of the parliamentary session, expressing disappointment that the parliament had not voted upon the power-sharing agreement before voting for the president. Allawi then spoke to CNN, telling the network that they viewed the power-sharing process to be ""dead"" and that they were expecting more ""tensions and violence"".  
 Iraqis went to the polls on March 7 to elect members of the Council of Representatives. In this election, the al-Iraqiya List won 91 seats, becoming the largest party in the parliament. However, in order to form a government, a party needs to hold 163 seats in the 325 seat Council. The Shia-Backed State of Law Coalition, led by current Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and the Kurdish-supported Kurdistan List, led by Dr. Barham Salih, won 89 and 43 seats respectively, giving them more seats together than al-Iraqiya, but still far from enough to form a government. 
 Eight months of disagreement on coalition-forming culminated in a compromise on Thursday in which Nouri al-Maliki would remain Prime Minister of Iraq, while Ayad Allawi would become leader of the new National Council for Strategic Policies, offering ""a check on al-Maliki's power"". President Jalal Talabani would retain his position as well. Lawmakers also elected al-Iraqiya member Osama al-Nujaifi as Parliamentary Speaker. The problems began when al-Iraqiya believed the election of al-Nujaifi as Speaker was insufficient representation for the party in Parliament. This coupled with the fact that the rest of the parliament voted down the request to vote on the power-sharing agreement, led members of al-Iraqiya to walk out of the parliamentary session.
Foreign Diplomats and Iraqi politicians have been scrambling to try and salvage the agreement. Al-Iraqiya announced its plans on Saturday to boycott the parliamentary session on Saturday.
 On Saturday al-Iraqiya returned to the negotiating table; a spokesman for al-Iraqiya characterised the walkout as a ""misunderstanding"".  With the help of al-Iraqiya, the parliament approved the power-sharing agreement agreed upon by the parties, as well as beginning to lift the ban on Ba'athist politicians in the parliament — which the Sunni population had felt unfairly targeted them.

 The lawmakers overcame a key dispute about how to conduct the election in northern Iraq's ethnically-mixed and oil-rich city of Kirkuk.
 Iraqi Kurds have long sought to incorporate Kirkuk into their autonomous region in northern Iraq. However, many of the city's Arab and Turkmen residents oppose such a move and want to remain under the control of Iraq's central government.
 Iraq's upcoming national elections are a crucial test for the country as it takes more responsibility for its own security ahead of a gradual withdrawal of US forces.

 ""Unfortunately, we have lost time for January 16. We have sent a letter to parliament telling them we have lost that date. Still there is an opportunity to have the election in time, according to the constitution [...] by the 31st of January,"" he said, speaking to Al Jazeera.
 It was not clear if the delayed passage of the law will give Iraqi authorities enough time to hold the elections as scheduled in mid-January. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had warned that Iraq could spiral into a new cycle of chaos if the elections do not go ahead.

"," Members of Parliament in Italy voted yesterday in support of the introduction of same-sex civil unions. The vote passed by 369 to 193 by Italy's lower house, the Chamber of Deputies. The upper house approved the bill in February. 
 Prime Minister Matteo Renzi called for a vote of confidence in the government and a successful vote has passed approval on the bill automatically. Italy was the last major western country where same-sex relationships were legally unrecognized.
 ""Today is a day of celebration for so many people"", Renzi wrote before the vote on his Facebook page. ""We are writing another important page of the Italy we want [...] It was no longer acceptable to have any more delays after years of failed attempts."" 
 The bill has been criticized for not going far enough to create equality for gay couples. Compared to some other European countries the bill does not stretch as far on such issues as adoption. A previous proposal calling for a pledge of loyalty, which would have made the unions more similar to marriage, was dropped. Despite this gay couples have more rights under the bill, such as the right to take a partner's name.
 Organization Arcigay national secretary Gabriele Piazzoni said of the vote, ""The glass is half-full. The text contains the recognition and protection many gays and lesbians have been waiting for all their lives [...] [but] everything this law has failed to guarantee leaves a bitter taste."" 
 Religion was a factor in the passing of this vote as well as previous attempts. Italy is largely Roman Catholic. Speaking to newspaper la Repubblica, Archbishop Michele Pennisi said ""There is a large part of the country that did not want this law passed."" He also criticized that the vote was brought through using a confidence vote, a move he referred to as ""creeping fascism"".

"," Romano Prodi, the Prime Minister of Italy, resigned Thursday evening after losing a vote of confidence in the Senate by a vote of 161-156.
 The vote comes in the wake of a growing crisis regarding corruption charges against Prodi's former Minister of Justice, Clemente Mastella.  Prodi's fate was sealed when the UEDUR Populars, a smaller component of Prodi's ruling Olive Tree coalition, broke ranks and voted against him.
 Prodi did win the confidence vote in the Chamber of Deputies, but was not expected to win the vote in the Senate.  Some believed he would resign before the Senate vote and avoid the embarrassment of losing the majority approval of Parliament.
 The President of Italy, Giorgio Napolitano, must now decide whether to appoint a new Prime Minister or to dissolve Parliament and schedule new elections. Some want a reform of election rules before a new election is called. Recent opinion polls indicate that Silvio Berlusconi would become Prime Minister once more if elections were held.
 It was the current election rules, introduced by Berlusconi during his most recent stint as Prime Minister, that allowed Prodi to assume power after the 2006 parliamentary elections.
 ""Now we must go to vote. We will say what we want to do in the first 100 days of our government,"" said former prime minister and opposition leader Berlusconi, demanding elections.
 In a speech prior to the vote, Prodi said, ""Stopping the government's work is a luxury Italy cannot afford,"" and warned that Italy ""cannot afford a power vacuum.""

"," The incumbent President of Italy Sergio Mattarella was re-elected for a second seven-year term yesterday in the eighth round of voting for a potential successor.
 Aged 80, Mattarella repeatedly expressed his desire to leave the position, including renting an apartment in Rome in anticipation of a move from the presidential Quirinal Palace (Quirinale). However, he relented after key figures, including Prime Minister Mario Draghi, urged him to stay on for the ""stability"" of the Republic. His first term was set to expire on February 3.
 Parliamentarians who went to Quirinale to ask him to remain quoted Mattarella as saying ""I had other plans, but if needed, I am at your disposition"". Seven rounds of fruitless voting to determine a successor involved an electoral college of 1009 ""grand electors"". They comprise 321 Senators, 630 Members of the Chamber of Deputies (MPs) and 58 regional delegates.
 Reuters characterised the Parliament's failure to rally around a compromise candidate as leaving ""deep scars, with potentially dangerous repercussions for political stability"" in the Draghi-led party coalition. Reuters added there was ""loud and prolonged applause"" in the Chamber of Deputies when Mattarella did break the two-thirds majority needed to secure re-election. He won with a total of 759 votes.
 Party leaders' statements issued yesterday were generally in favour of Mattarella staying in power. Matteo Salvini, leader of anti-migrant party Lega per Salvini Premier, said ""Italians don't deserve more days of confusion"". He confirmed ""President Mattarella at the Quirinale and Draghi at the government"". Draghi was himself a candidate who was ""tipped for the job"" according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). He said after the election it was ""splendid news for Italians"" and he was ""grateful to the President for his decision to go along with the extremely strong will of Parliament"".
 Salvini, who Euronews says is eyeing the role of Prime Minister, expressed his desire for Mattarella to continue serving yesterday evening. ""We think that it isn't serious any more to continue with 'no's' and cross vetoes"", he said. He thus believed the time was right to ""tell the president to reconsider"". None of the candidates he endorsed received the requisite majority of votes after being ""rejected by the left"". Mattarella also gained post-election support in messages by Enrico Letta, who heads the centre-left Democratic Party and Minister of Health Roberto Speranza, who leads social democracy party Article One.
 Former Prime Minister, president of centre-right party Forza Italia and presidential candidate Silvio Berlusconi also endorsed Mattarella, around whom he said ""[u]nity today can only be found"".
 However, the decision was sharply criticised by Giorgia Meloni, the leader of the far-right opposition party Brothers of Italy. Meloni said in a statement ""Parliament has shown it is not fit for Italians"". Accusing allies of ""bartering away"" the role of the presidency, she called for the bloc to be ""re-founded"". Meloni tweeted last evening ""I would be surprised if #Mattarella agreed to be re-elected after having repeatedly rejected this hypothesis."" She instead favoured Draghi to take the office. This course would leave the Prime Minister's seat vacant and potentially invoke early elections.
 Giuseppe Conte, leader of Parliament's largest party the populist Five Star Movement told reporters ""Mattarella is the guarantor of everybody, impartial, authoritative"". Conte resigned as Prime Minister in 2021 over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.
 Though mostly ceremonial, the President is charged with appointing the Prime Minister and dissolving Parliament, which the BBC says means the office ""takes on great power during times of political crisis"". This comes in the context of intense fragmentation in Italian politics that means governments typically survive about a year.
 Mattarella was praised for his role in ending the brief 2021 Italian government crisis by appointing the broad coalition of parties headed by Draghi. Draghi, an independent who was president of the European Central Bank during the European debt crisis, was tasked to remedy the worst economic disaster Italy has faced in decades. Wolfango Piccoli of advisory firm Teneo told Reuters: ""The overall political backdrop has become less supportive for Draghi's government, which is facing a daunting task in the year or so left before the next general election.""
 BBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen wrote parliamentarians' choice to re-elect a hesitant incumbent would ""be seen by critics as an embarrassing show of Italy's political divisions"". There were calls for Italy to elect its first female president or someone younger (although candidates must be over 50). Their failure to do so was thus symbolic of ""the lack of imagination of [Italian] MPs to think beyond the status quo."" Support for Mattarella was reportedly the only thing most MPs agreed on, Forza Italia national co-ordinator Antonio Tajani said in a BBC interview.
 Mattarella, seen as a traditional but quiet and unassuming President according to Reuters, was first elected in 2015. He had previously served as Minister of Public Education, Minister of Defence, Deputy Prime Minister and judge of the Constitutional Court. He additionally served as MP for two decades. His father helped found the Christian Democracy party, while his brother Piersanti Mattarella served as President of Sicily before being assassinated in 1980.
 Other candidates for the post indicated by the AFP last week included former Prime Ministers Giuliano Amato and Paolo Gentiloni and former Chamber of Deputies President Pier Ferdinando Casini. Female candidates included current and former Ministers of Justice Marta Cartabia and Paola Severino and Senate President Elisabetta Casellati.

The measures had previously passed in the Chamber of Deputies, Italy's lower house, with a 402 to 75 vote.
 The economic changes include raising the retirement and state pension age, the reintroduction of a local housing tax, spending cuts on health, and a ban on cash transactions over €1,000 (US$1,300 or £830) to prevent tax evasion.
 Monti told the Senate before the vote: ""Our country's credibility is essential to overcome the crisis, just as it's also essential for our economy to return to growth"". The economic reforms have been supported by the People of Freedom, the political party of former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.
 However, Umberto Bossi from the Lega Nord party attacked the plans, claiming ""[i]t's got too many taxes and above all, it doesn't create jobs."" Trade unions are also expected to oppose the changes.

"," Silvio Berlusconi has survived a key no-confidence vote against a minister in his cabinet accused of corruption. The vote was the first test of the strength of the Prime Minister's coalition since the dramatic split with his 16-year ally Gianfranco Fini, which led to the coalition losing the majority.
 Yesterday the lower house voted 299 to 229 to reject the no-confidence motion brought against Giacomo Caliendo. Caliendo is a junior minister for justice accused of involvement in a secret cabal that reportedly tried to influence judical and government appointments. His resignation was called for by the opposition but, crucially, it was the abstention of 75 members of the senate, Gianfranco Fini's rebels, that led to the motion being defeated.
 The abstention averted a confrontation between the coalition and the rebels but it can also be seen as a show of strength by the renegades, a way of showing their powerful influence while avoiding a dispute.
 Although superficially the motion's rejection appears to show that the coalition government can still be effective without a majority, The Telegraph's website commented that it demonstrates that Fini's rebels are now in a position to control the outcome of votes in the house, since their support or their abstention can mean the difference between a motion passing or being rejected.
 The motion's defeat also means that the early elections that looked to be on the horizon may be put off. The elections could have been called early due to the rupture in the party but now may be postponed until later this year. Berlusconi's closest ally Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League party, said: ""This means that we are resisting and that we will not go to the polls for now."" However Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, also of the Northern League party, said yesterday that elections later this year could not be ruled out.
 The alleged influence-peddling that junior minister Caliendo is accused of is the same kind of moral and legal issue that has dogged Berlusconi's government, and the kind of issue that led Fini to lead the break away from the coalition. The Prime Minister may be facing impeachment after Italy's Constitutional Court overturned a law granting him immunity from prosecution. Even though the defeat of this motion means the  coalition has passed the first test of strength, it may not do it much good if the Prime Minister faces prosecution.

 The move received sharp criticism from allies of Italy. In Washington, a senior State Department official said the United States was pleased the journalist had been released unharmed, but was troubled by possible ramifications of the swap.

It is the intention of this government to propose to Parliament the return of our troops from Iraq."" His speech resulted in jeers from Italy's centre right parties.
 Mr Prodi said his government intends to continue ""good relations"" with Washington. He did not give a date for a withdrawal, saying a ""technical timeframe"" would have to be agreed with all sides involved. Italy's centre-left parties opposed the US-led invasion of Iraq three years ago. 
 Mr Prodi said his government will remain on the front lines in the war against terror and would participate in anti-terror operations if they were sanctioned by international organizations, such as the United Nations. ""We are convinced participants in the war against terrorism, even militarily, when it is legitimized by an international organization to which we belong."" he said.

"," Eluana Englaro, who had been in a persistent vegetative state since 1992 following an automobile accident, died Monday at the ""La Quiete"" clinic in Udine, where doctors stopped feeding her four days ago. The case has sparked a debate about euthanasia, as well as a political crisis.
 Euthanasia is illegal in Italy, however, refusing treatment is not. On Friday doctors removed her feeding tubes in accordance with a November 2008 ruling by the Constitutional Court of Italy that it was within her father's rights to order the cessation of feeding.
 Eluana's father, Beppino Englaro, fought a ten-year battle to remove his daughter's feeding tubes. He and Eluana's friends testified that this would have been according to her own wishes.
 Beppino Englaro delivered the news of Eluana's death by telling ANSA: ""Yes, she has left us, but I don't want to say anything, I just want to be alone.""
 In an interview with The Guardian last week, Beppino Englaro said: ""If she couldn't be what she was [before the 1992 accident] then she would not have wanted to live.""
 In the last days of Eluana's life, the Italian government, led by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, sought to intervene to save her life. The Vatican backed the government's position.
 At the time of her death, the Italian Senate was working on a law to force doctors to resume feeding Eluana. When her death was announced, the Senate held a moment of silence as a sign of respect. The legislation is continuing and could affect future right-to-die cases.
 Berlusconi said that he felt ""deep pain and regret"" for not saving her life. On Sunday, he said, ""I can guarantee on my honour and that of my ministers, that our decision was based on moral principles and there was never a plan to attack anybody.""
 Friday, Berlusconi had attempted to issue a decree to prevent the feeding tubes from being removed. This was however rejected by President Giorgio Napolitano who said it violated high court orders, triggering a constitutional crisis.
 Massimo D'Alema of the opposition party, Democratic Party of the Left, criticized the Prime Minister. ""Berlusconi has little knowledge of the constitutional culture,"" he said. ""He is a bully who wants to question the president's constitutional democratic powers."" 
 The Italian Minister of Health Maurizio Sacconi attempted to halt the proceedings on a technicality. According to his office, the court had specified for Eluana Englaro to die in a hospice, which the ""La Quiete"" clinic technically is not.
 Eluana Englaro's long-time neurologist, Carlo Alberto Defanti, had erroneously predicted that she would survive another eight to ten days.
 ""Apart from her brain injuries, Eluana is a healthy woman. She has never been ill and never took antibiotics,"" said Dr. Defanti on Sunday. ""It was something we did not foresee,"" he said of her death on Monday.
 Defanti said he did ""the right thing... I am helping a person achieve her own wish, a defenseless person who was betrayed by everyone except her father and a few other people.""
 Professor Antonio de Monte, an anesthesiologist who also provided care for her said: ""Eluana died 17 years ago.""
 At Sunday's noon blessing, Pope Benedict XVI said, without direct reference to the case, ""Let us pray for all the sick, especially those most seriously ill, who cannot in any way provide for themselves, but are totally dependent on the care of others. Let each of them experience, in the care of those who are near them, the power of God's love and the wealth of his saving grace.""
 According to The Times, opinion polls showed the people of Italy to be evenly divided 47/47, with 6 percent undecided, on the issue.
 Beppino Englaro and observers have called Eluana ""Italy’s Terri Schiavo"" in reference to the United States Terri Schiavo case in 2005, which resulted in Terri, who was also in a vegetative state, being allowed to die after attempted legislative intervention.

He said, ""Any terror organization can raise its flag there, [but] there can be no trace of the Israeli flag. Only Jews are forbidden to pray at this place.""
 During the debate, Labor MK Eitan Cabel reacted to Feiglin's motion, ""Why stop at the Temple Mount? If you are the new messiah of our times, what about"" — he named various specifics of the holy promise of the lands of the Greater Israel — ""Why leave them behind?"" A ""Greater Israel"" promised by God is generally considered off limits in civic discourse inside Israel. The Knesset did not vote on the issue.
 Al-Aqsa Mosque ranks just behind Mecca and  Medina as the holiest of Islamic sites. Jews consider the Temple Mount to be their holiest site.

 The Harper goverment says Canada, since 1993 when the Palestinian Authority was established, has given the PA assistance worth C$650 million; and the current assistance aims to support the Palestinian peace process, security, and humanitarian aid.
 Harper's visit included a view of Old Jerusalem from the top of the Mount of Olives and a visit to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. In his visit to Israel, Harper met with the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, and became the first Canadian Prime Minister to give a speech at the Israeli parliament. Also, he met with the President of the Palestinian Authority, Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, in Ramallah. During the meeting Harper announced providing the assistance.
 At a joint press conference with Mahmoud Abbas, Harper said his position isn't Israeli or Palestinian but Canadian, and added he won't criticize Israel during his first visit to the Middle East.  
 However, Dr. Nabeel Shaath — Fatah's foreign relations commissioner, member of the PLO Political Committee, and former PA foreign minister — criticized the visit and the policy which Harper leads with his attitude towards Palestine in an article for the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail and said, ""Unlike previous governments, the current Canadian government has done everything possible in order to undermine Palestine's international status [...] and Canada's lobby against Palestine's UN bid have taken Canada outside of international consensus, making Canada part of the problem rather than part of the solution.""

"," On Sunday, Dr. Azmi Bishara, leader of the Balad Arab nationalist political party in Israel and member of the Israeli Knesset (Israeli Parliament) compared the current military actions by Israel unfavorably with similar previous conflicts in Lebanon.
 In an article for the Arab Times Bishara said; ""The only difference between today and the earlier bombardments — the 'Day of Reckoning' and 'Grapes of Wrath' between 1993 and 1996 — is that Syrian forces are no longer present in Lebanon.""
 American Spencer Witt, who is filing daily reports from Lebanon, compared the difficulty average citizens are having today with those experienced during past operations; ""Etienne was a freshman in high school during Operation Grapes of Wrath — 16 days of Israeli strikes that resulted in the destruction of Lebanese power plants and left much of the country in the dark. And now this."" Witt said.
 Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has said that the killing of 8 Israeli soldiers and the abduction of another two soldiers by Hezbollah militants on July 12 was an act of war; ""The murderous attack this morning was not a terror attack but an act of war,"" Olmert said. Lebanon has Hezbollah members in its parliament and ""must bear full responsibility. Israel's response will be restrained but very, very, very painful."" Olmert said on July 12, 2006.
 Olmert told Israeli legislators today that; ""We want a two-kilometer (1.2-mile) space from the border in which it will not be possible to fire rockets toward soldiers and civilians houses and in which there will not be contact with military border patrols.""
 Israeli soldiers previously patrolled a ""security zone"" during Israel's 18-year occupation of south Lebanon. Olmert said today; ""We do not have any intention of returning to the security zone but want to create an area where there will be no Hezbollah."" and he repeated Israel's call for an international force (being referred to as ""muscular"" or ""robust"") to be put on the Israel-Lebanon border.
 ""We need international intervention forces that have military capabilities and ability to respond and enforce, and not forces similar to UNIFIL."" he said, referring to U.N. peacekeepers. ""I don't know when there will be a cease-fire. This is difficult, but we will stand up to this. ... We want to end the violent operation as quickly as possible but we won't end it before we believe we can achieve results that justify the price we have paid.""
 Dr. Bishara lambasted every aspect of Israel's position in this current conflict; ""Any comparison between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's and Hezbollah chief Nasrallah's political rhetoric must conclude that the latter is the more rational. His speeches are more consistent with the facts and rely less than Olmert's on religious expressions and allusions...Israeli politicians have no cultural or moral edge over resistance leaders. The latter are far less attached to Iran than the former are to the US...The people who unleashed the brutal war against Lebanon are neither intelligent nor courageous. Quite the opposite; they are mediocrities, cowards and opportunists, but they happen to have military superiority. And they possess the keys to the machinery of a state, a real state, one that is secure in its identity, that has clear national security goals and channels of national mobilization, as opposed to a long deferred project for statehood and a states built on the fragmentation of national identity."" 
 Regarding the current conflict, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told an Israeli parliament committee Wednesday that Israel would not reoccupy any part of southern Lebanon.
 However, speaking on Israeli army radio, Justice Minister Haim Ramon - a close confidant of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert - said ""everyone understands that a victory for Hezbollah is a victory for world terror"". He said that in order to prevent casualties amongst Israeli soldiers battling Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon, villages should be flattened by the Israeli air force before ground troops move in. 
 ""All those now in south Lebanon are terrorists who are related in some way to Hezbollah,"" Mr Ramon said.
 Mr Ramon's call for the use of greater firepower came as the Israeli cabinet was set to decide whether to broaden its military offensive.

Likud got 11 or 12 seats, the National Religious Party took 8 or 9 seats and Shas 10 or 11 seats. The Pensioners party performed better than expected, capturing 6 to 8 seats, United Torah Judaism got 5 to 6 seats and Meretz around 5 seats. Arab parties are expected to get 7 or 8 seats.

 Rau was born on January 16, 1931 in Wuppertal. He first joined the Gesamtdeutsche Volkspartei in 1952. After the party had been dissolved, he followed his political mentor Gustav Heinemann to the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). He was elected member of the state legislature of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1958 and became governor of the state in 1978. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the chancellorship in 1987.

"," The centrist Kadima Party won a plurality of the seats in Knesset, the Israel parliament, in Tuesday's election beating out the right-wing Likud Party by a single seat.
 The ninth and current Israel President Shimon Peres will call on Tzipora Malka ""Tzipi"" Livni, Kadima party leader to attempt to form a government through a coalition. This will be difficult for Livini as Hard line parties including Likud won a majority of the seats in the Knesset. Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu might be tapped to form a coalition government if Livni fails. 65.2% percent of the voting population voted on Tuesday.
 The key issue which has faced some 5.3 million registered voters, in 9,000 polling stations nationwide is which leader can best assure the security of the state while chances of a peace deal seem remote amid a campaign that generated little enthusiasm.
 Political analysts are predicting that Mr. Netanyahu, not Ms. Livni, will be asked by Israel's president to form the next government. 
 Both Ms. Livni and Mr. Netanyahu are courting the third-place Yisrael Beitenu Party, headed by Avigdor Lieberman. Yisrael Beitenu party which won 15 seats is seen as critical in securing the 61 seats required in the country's 120-seat parliament. 
 Another possible political scenario would be a power-sharing government between Ms. Livni and Mr. Netanyahu, in which each leader would serve as prime minister for two years, rotating midway through the four year term. 
 ""Netanyahu and Livni complement one another. You have the common sense of Livni and the broader strategic vision of Netanyahu. Bibi needs her and she needs him,” said Daniel Schueftan, a senior Israeli academic and deputy director of the National Security Studies Center at the University of Haifa, where he also serves as a senior lecturer in the School of Political Sciences. 
 The Knesset (כנסת) is the legislature of Israel, located in Givat Ram, Jerusalem. It was first convened on February 14, 1949, following the elections held on January 20th 1949. As the legislative branch of the Israeli government, it enacts laws, elects the president and prime minister (although s/he is ceremonially appointed by the President), supervises the work of the government, reserves the power to remove the President of the State and the State Comptroller from office and to dissolve itself and call new elections.
 The composition of the current Knesset was determined by the 2006 election, the Seventeenth Knesset. Though it has not yet happened in the current session, in every Knesset to date (save the remarkably stable 1955 Third), parties have split up during the Knesset's term, leading to the creation of new parties or resulting in MKs sitting as independents. 
 Last December, a record 43 parties had registered with the parties registrar, compared to 31 for the 2006 elections, although in the end, only 34 parties submitted a list of candidates. On 12 January 2009, Balad and the United Arab List–Ta'al alliance were disqualified by the Central Elections Committee on the grounds that they failed to recognise Israel as a Jewish state and called for armed conflict against it. Balad and Ta'al were also disqualified from the 2003 election, but won a Supreme Court case which allowed them to run. On January 21, the Supreme Court, by a vote of 8 to 1, again revoked the ban.
 Every 4 years (or sooner if an early election is called, as is often the case), 120 members of the Knesset (MKs) are elected by Israeli citizens who must be at least 18 years old to vote. The Government of Israel must be approved by a majority vote of the Knesset. 120 seats are allocated by party-list proportional representation, using the d'Hondt method. The election threshold for the 2006 election was set at 2% (up from 1.5% in previous elections), which is a little over two seats.   
 After official results are published (on February 18, in this election), the President of Israel delegates the task of forming a government to the Member of Knesset with the best chance of assembling a majority coalition (usually the leader of the largest party.) That designee has up to 42 days to negotiate with the different parties, and then present his government to the Knesset for a vote of confidence. Once the government is approved (by a vote of at least 61 members), he/she becomes Prime Minister.
 Kadima leaders believe that Livni can form a coalition with at least Labor, Meretz and Israel Beiteinu. Livni and Netanyahu have started meeting with potential government coalition partners, Livni with Avigdor Lieberman of ultranational party, Yisrael Beiteinu and Netanyahu with Eli Yishai of the Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party.
 Benjamin ""Bibi"" Netanyahu (בִּנְיָמִין ""ביבי"" נְתַנְיָהוּ) was the 9th Prime Minister of Israel (June 1996 to July 1999) and is Chairman of the conservative Likud Party. He is the first (and to date only) Prime Minister of Israel to be born after the State of Israel's foundation.
 Netanyahu was Finance Minister of Israel until 9 August 2005, having resigned in protest at the Gaza Disengagement Plan advocated by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. He retook the Likud leadership on 20 December 2005. 
 As of December 2006, he became the official leader of the Opposition in the Knesset and Chairman of the Likud Party. In August 2007 he retained the Likud leadership by beating Moshe Feiglin in party elections.  
 On May 4, 2006, Ehud Olmert (אהוד אולמרט) became the 12th and current Prime Minister of Israel. He was the mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 to 2003, was elected to the Knesset and became a minister and an Acting Prime Minister in the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. 
 On January 4, 2006, after Sharon suffered a severe hemorrhagic stroke, Olmert began exercising the powers of the office of Prime Minister. He led Kadima to a victory in the March 2006 elections (just two months after Sharon had suffered his stroke) and continued on as Acting Prime Minister. 
 On April 14, 2006, Sharon was declared permanently incapacitated, allowing Olmert to legally become Interim Prime Minister. On 4 May, 2006, Olmert and his new, post-election government were approved by the Knesset, thus Olmert officially became Prime Minister of Israel.
 Olmert faced corruption charges amid a challenge for leadership from Kadima by Foreign Minister Tzipora Malka ""Tzipi"" Livni (ציפורה מלכה ""ציפי"" לבני), age 50, the Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Israel. Livini is a lawyer, mother-of-two and former agent for Mossad Israel's foreign intelligence agency who has moved from a strongly Zionist nationalist background to become a leading Israeli advocate of a two-state solution with Palestinians. 
 On July 30, 2008, Olmert announced that he would not seek re-election as party leader and that he would resign from his position as Prime Minister immediately after a new Kadima leader was named. On September 17, 2008, Livni won the election and became the new leader of the Kadima party. She sought to form a new government that would gain support from a majority of the Knesset. 
 After failing to reach agreement with various parties, Livni's attempts at forming a new government were unsuccessful and instead an election was scheduled for February 10, 2009. Aside from Livini and Netanyahu, the other candidates were Ehud Barak, the 10th Prime Minister of Israel, and current Minister of Defense, deputy prime minister and leader of Israel's centre-left Labor Party, and Avigdor Lieberman, the leader of the far-right party Yisrael Beiteinu. 
 The hiatus allowed Olmert to cling to his Prime Minister post for at least a further five months as head of a caretaker government. On December, 2008, Operation Cast Lead was launched on Gaza. The February 10 election came three weeks after a 22-day Israel–Gaza conflict, where Israeli military offensive in the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip killed more than 1,300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. 
 Meanwhile, Avigdor Lieberman, whose Yisrael Beiteinu faction received 15 Knesset seats, thereby holding the key to the makeup of the 18th Knesset, has on Thursday  unexpectedly departed for vacation abroad, leaving his suitors from Kadima and Likud -- as well as the Israeli public -- in the dark about his intentions. 
 “Our position is already clear and I know exactly what I am going to tell President Shimon Peres. [But] in order to know whom we are going to recommend, we will wait six more days,” Lieberman said. “I think it is too early and there is no point saying whom we support. I have met with both Livni and Netanyahu and with additional people in the political system but my position is already clear and solid. When we go to the President we will say very clear things,” he added.
 The Israeli Central Elections Committee, charged under the 1969 Knesset Elections Law to carry out the elections for the Knesset has planned to release the final results on February 18 after tallying more than 150,000 ballots, consisting mainly of votes of absentees (those from abroad - soldiers in military camps and foreign service staff, overseas diplomat missions, prisoners, hospital staff, and surplus votes that are calculated to move to other parties to form the final results within 48 hours of the closing of the polls). 
 These remaining votes could tip the balance in the gridlocked election and determine the leadership. The elections officials have also released the List of Knesset members. *The Knesset Board of Elections on Thursday states on their site that results are ""final but not official.""
 The unofficial election results (based on 99.7% of votes) has raised one question - whether Netanyahu might be chosen to serve as Prime Minister, given Likud's possible political ability to form a coalition with Yisrael Beiteinu. Another alternative was for Kadima to form a national unity government. But this has seemed unlikely given that it would probably require Tzipi Livni to win Likud's support for any such unity coalition. 
 The real resolution of the electoral deadlock has hinged on the actions of President Shimon Peres, age, 85, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, as the official in charge of deciding which party should be chosen to form a governing coalition. Observers have pointed to his personal political similarities with Livni as one possible reason for choosing Kadima. On the other hand, Netanyahu's ability to form a true coalition also seemed like one significant consideration. 
 However, the stability of a right-wing/religious coalition is questionable. The six right wing parties control just 65 seats, leaving such a coalition vulnerable to internal dissention. In any case, President Peres has announced that he will not entertain any attempts to form a government until February 18, when the final results will be certified.
 President Barack Obama has phoned Peres Wednesday and wished him well in overseeing the formation of a new government. “You have only two political parties -- we have 12,” Peres told Obama. The new coalition government that emerges after February 18, whether it is led by hard-line Netanyahu or his moderate rival, Tzipi Livni, is likely to find common ground on two burning issues: Hamas and Iran. 
 Two dire scenarios emerged Wednesday as President Obama faces double dilemmas in Mideast: a narrow coalition of hawks who would stall peacemaking with the Palestinians and a power-sharing arrangement that would give Israel a more moderate face and greater international support. 
 ""We want to do things differently in the region. That would involve accelerating efforts to promote Mideast peace talks as well as having discourse with Iran in an environment of mutual respect,"" Obama said at his White House news conference Monday. ""We certainly hope that a new (Israeli) government will continue to pursue a path to peace. I see no reason to think a new government would do something otherwise,"" US State Department spokesman Robert Wood said.
 ""Divisions in the Israeli electorate are likely to create 'paralysis in the political process' during the period of coalition building and perhaps beyond. This could lead to an extended ""hiatus"" in peacemaking while the Palestinians confront their own deep political divisions. Nevertheless, the United States should work hard to firm up the Gaza cease-fire and not to give up on the longer-term goal of a two-state solution,"" said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former top U.S. diplomat in the Mideast and a recent adviser to Barack Obama.
 ""The Israeli political system has been fractured and at odds with itself for many years, so having an outcome in which the two big blocs--the center-right and moderate-right blocs--split the vote was not at all unexpected. There will be a paralysis in the political process, certainly during the period of coalition building and perhaps even beyond, depending on what kind of coalition emerges. The hiatus in peacemaking could be rather extended,"" he explained.

"," Opposition parties to Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, led by Yesh Atid's Yair Lapid informed president Reuven Rivlin of the formation of an eight-party coalition just ahead of Wednesday's midnight deadline, preventing what could have been the country's fifth election in two years.
 The ""government of change"", which Lapid announced had the support of a majority of opposition parties in the Israeli parliament, or Knesset, still needs to pass a parliamentary vote of confidence expected to take place this week.  Should it do so, Netanyahu's twelve-year tenure of fifteen years total as Israel's longest-serving prime minister would end, being replaced by head of right-wing party Yamina Naftali Bennett, a staunch advocate for the controversial Israeli settlement in the West Bank and opponent of an independent state of Palestine.
 Under the rotation agreement agreed by the eight parties, Bennett will serve as prime minister for the first two years of a four-year term, and Lapid foreign minister, according to CNN.  The two men will then swap on August 27, 2023 according to the BBC.
 The coalition is comprised of parties with a wide array of interests, including the United Arab List, also known by its Hebrew acronym Ra'am and led by Mansour Abbas, which became the first Arab party in Israeli history to partner in the formation of a government.  According to the Associated Press (AP), the agreement secured a number of concessions in Abbas' favour, including legal recognition for villages by the Bedouin minority in southern Israel and a plan to invest ILS30 billion and reduce violent crime in Arab communities.
 According to the BBC, the other five parties that ensured a 62-seat majority of a required 61 in the 120-seat Knesset are Blue and White with eight seats and led by Benny Gantz, Yisrael Beiteinu with seven seats and led by Avigdor Lieberman, the Israeli Labor Party with seven seats and led by Merav Michaeli, New Hope with six seats and led by Gideon Sa'ar and Meretz with six seats and led by Nitzan Horowitz.  Yesh Atid has seventeen seats and is the largest opposition party.
 The parties have little in common with one another apart than a desire to oust the prime minister.
 In announcing the coalition, Lapid promised ""[t]his government will work for all the citizens of Israel, those that voted for it and those that didn’t. It will do everything to unite Israeli society"".  According to the AP, Michaeli said ""[t]oday, we succeeded. We made history"".  A tweet by Gantz translated by The Jerusalem Post called last night one ""of great hope"".  On the decision of the United Arab List to join the coalition, the BBC reported Abbas calling the decision ""hard"" and with ""several disputes but it was important to reach agreements"".
 Former justice minister Yossi Beilin told Al Jazeera, ""The situation in which eight medium and small parties are forming a coalition has never happened before. It will not be easy. [...] We should cross our fingers and hope that this government will not only oust Netanyahu, but it will also be able to perform and to be sustainable"".  Leader of the Religious Zionist Party with six seats in the Knesset Itamar Ben-Gvir tweeted sarcastically ""I managed to form a government with supporters of terrorism. Yours, Naftali Bennett"".
 While Netanyahu has yet to speak on the matter, member for his party of Likud Miki Zohar tweeted ""The Left celebrates, but this is a very sad day for the State of Israel.""  On Sunday, according to CNN and The Guardian, the prime minister called the proposed coalition ""a leftwing government dangerous to the state of Israel"" and the ""fraud of the century"", accusing Bennett of being someone who ""only cares about himself.""
 A working coalition was sought by both Netanyahu and the opposition after the 2021 Israeli legislative election this March left neither side with a majority.  According to Al Jazeera, Yamina, with seven seats in the Knesset, refused to work with emergent ""kingmaker"" of the United Arab List with four.

The decision means that the families do not receive the compensation as family members of people classed as victims of terrorism. The laws governing compensation only recognise terrorism as being perpetrated by ""organisations hostile to Israel"".

"," The Israeli parliament, the Knesset, has initially voted in favor of two bills, the ""Loyalty Oath Law"" and the ""Nakba Law"", both of which have sparked major controversy and are aimed at Palestinians living in Israel who are critical of Israeli policies in the occupied territories.
 The first law, the 'Loyalty Oath Law', makes any ""call to negate Israel's existence as a Jewish and democratic state, where the content of such publication would have a reasonable possibility of causing an act of hatred, disdain or disloyalty"" a criminal offense punishable with imprisonment of up to one year. Naomi Chazan, president of the liberal New Israel Fund called the bill an ""attempt to trample on the feelings of pain of Israeli Arabs"". 
 The second law, the 'Nakba Law', makes marking the Nakba illegal.  The Nakba is commemorated in the Arab world as marking the day when Palestinians were dispossessed of their lands for the creation of the Israeli state.  
 Another law proposed this week, by the Yisrael Beiteinu party, requires a citation of a loyalty oath to Israel in order to gain a compulsory identification card.
 During the debate on the initial Loyalty Oath Law in the Knesset its proponents faced serious attacks from the opposition. Ronnie Bar-On of Kadima asserted existing law sufficed, and disdained the new legislation, saying, ""You want to punish people for talking? Soon, will you want to punish for thoughts?""
 The bills have all passed initial readings, but have to be further voted upon and passed to a committee review before taking effect as legislation.

"," Israel's Shas Party said yesterday that it would not be joining the coalition proposed by the current Foreign Minister and Prime Minister-designate Tzipi Livni. The ultra-Orthodox right-wing party, which is the fourth largest in the Knesset, claims that the coalition has been unwilling to meet its two demands; increasing child allowances and having a no compromise view on Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem.
 Ms. Livni has already sealed talks with the Labour Party and some smaller parties, giving her 48 supporting MKs. But she needs at least 61 to get a majority in the 120-member Knesset, and the coalition must have been formed by November 3rd. So the refusal of Shas, which has 12 MKs, to join, comes as a major blow to her attempts. The New York Times reports that Livni is now entering talks with the left-wing Meretz-Yachad Party and the ultra-Orthodox United Torah Judaism Party, whose admissions would boost the supporter count to 66, easily enough to forge the alliance. 
 The leader of Shas, which was a member of the last governing coalition, stated on Friday that the decision of his party's Council of Torah Sages not to join was final, adding that ""Shas cannot be bought. We will stick to our goals and principles."" Despite this, Otniel Schneller, an MK from the Kadima party, which elected Livni as its leader after the corruption-based end to Ehud Olmert's premiership, said that ""I do not see this as the end of the story with Shas. I think we can still find a creative formula for Jerusalem and bring them back.""
 Livni's negotiation style has come under fire of late, political columnist Nahum Barnea writing that he believes she has involved herself too personally and ""has a tendency to impose deadlines when they are not necessary."" Indeed her imposition of a deadline for parties to join the coalition, set for tomorrow, was criticised from an official from her own party, who said: ""Livni has already been granted a 14-day extension  from Shimon Peres to assemble a coalition, so she may as well have waited a bit with the ultimatum"".
 If Ms. Livni does fail in preparing the alliance, the decision will be down to President Peres whether to nominate a different Knesset member to try to create a coalition, or to call an election. If one were held, The Los Angeles Times claims, polls show that the main beneficiary would be ex-Prime Minister and Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu.

"," Israel's foreign minister has reportedly boycotted Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's tour of the Middle East. Avigdor Lieberman did not attend Lula's address at the Knesset or his meeting with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. According to close sources, Lieberman refused to attend over President Lula's refusal to visit and to lay a wreath on the grave of Zionist movement founder Theodor Herzl. 
 Israel created a policy to honour Herzl's 150th birthday by having all visiting heads of state lay a wreath on his grave, however Lula's staff said they were only informed a week before his visit when his schedule had already been planned. 
 Treasurer of the World Zionist Movement Haggai Merom said that Lula's actions were an ""insult to Israel's citizens and to Zionist communities around the world, including to the Jewish community in Brazil."" He also compared his refusal to visit Herzl's grave to refusing to visit ""the grave of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in Turkey or the tomb of Mahatma Gandhi in India.""

183," Sunday, July 22, 2018 "," On Thursday, the Israeli parliament, the Knesset, passed the ""Jewish nation-state"" bill granting Israel the status of ""national home of the Jewish people"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it ""a defining moment in the annals of Zionism and the history of the state of Israel"".
 The bill was passed at 3 AM with 62–55 majority. Two lawmakers abstained. The bill declared Hebrew as the only official language and demoted Arabic from national language to a ""special status"" language. Netanyahu said, ""An absolute majority wants to ensure our state's Jewish characters for generations to come."" Speaker of the Knesset Yuli Edelstein said this bill, which received just 51.66% votes in favour out of the full Knesset of 120, was ""one of the most important laws ever to be passed by the Knesset"".
 The Knesset began the voting on Wednesday. Previously, the bill had clauses declaring the state as a Jewish-only community as well as direction for judiciary courts to consider Jewish values over democratic values. Both of the clauses were challenged by the Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and the Attorney General. The latter clause about Jewish values for courts was dropped in May; the other clause was eventually dropped, and the final draft of the bill was approved on Monday. The bill was first introduced in 2011 by the right-wing Likud party.
 The latest draft of the bill said the Hebrew calendar is to be the official calendar of the state. It also read, ""Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish people, in which the State of Israel was established"" and ""the state views the development of Jewish settlement as a national value and will act to encourage and promote its establishment and consolidation."" Israel is home to about 1.8 million Palestinians, who account for roughly 20% of the national population. The bill also declared Jerusalem, in its entirety, as the capital of Israel.
 The bill received negative reception from a number of people. The Arab Joint List multi-party alliance called it ""anti-democratic, colonialist, racist, and with clear characteristics of apartheid."" Calling it a ""shameful night"", Meretz Party's Tamar Zandberg said it was a ""debased and tainted law"". The Joint List's Ahmad Tibi questioned, ""Why are you afraid of the Arabic language?"".
 Last week, Netanyahu said, ""We will keep ensuring civil rights in Israel's democracy but the majority also has the rights and the majority decides"". Jeremy Ben-Ami, the president of J Street, a US-based Jewish Organisation, said the bill ""was born in sin, its only purpose is to send a message to the Arab community, the LGBT community and other minorities in Israel, that they are not and never will be equal citizens. Two months ago we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the Israeli Declaration of Independence, where it was written that the State of Israel 'will ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or gender.' Today Netanyahu's government is trying to ignore those words and the values that they represent.""

"," A convention of the Israeli Labor Party in Tel Aviv decided on Sunday to pull its ministers out of the coalition government with the Likud Party of prime minister Ariel Sharon.
 The decision results from an initative by party chair Amir Peretz, who was just elected to that office at the beginning of this month, succeeding Shimon Peres.
 In his speech to the convention, Peretz accused Sharon's government of ""humiliating"" immigrants and poor people and said it had deepend poverty in the country. He called on Likud voters to switch to Labor because, ""Likud has abandoned you"".
 Officials from both parties agreed that March 28, 2006 would be the date of early elections to the 17th Knesset.
 Earlier today, Sharon thanked Peres for the work in the government and proclaimed, ""Shimon, this is the beginning of our joint work"". This statement is seen as reaffirming rumors that Sharon may quit Likud and form a new party, due to several disagreements with the Likud in the past.

The vote passed 72-39, with three abstentions and six absent. The vote removes the last major hurdle for Mr. Sharon to implement the proposed plan, scheduled to start in July.
 Mr. Sharon's administration has not yet survived the upcoming vote on the 2005 budget, which takes place on Tuesday. But it has secured the support of the secular Shinui party, so a majority looks likely. Shinui had reservations about the amount of money transferred under the budget to projects organised by ultra-Orthodox parties. Under Israeli law, if the budget fails to pass, new elections must be held. Opponents of the disengagement plan intend to use the budget vote to topple Mr. Sharon's government, and several MK's attacked Shinui for their decision to support the budget.
 Mr. Sharon's position sparked a rebellion from his own center-right Likud party, with a significant majority of Likud MKs voting in favour of the bill, including several members of his own cabinet. Finance Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom, Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, and Education Minister Limor Livnat all voted in favour of a referendum.

"," Today, Israel President Shimon Peres has selected Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu to form the government of the 18th Knesset.   65 Members of Knesset informed the President of their preference of Netanyahu to head the government.
 President Peres was persuaded by two factors to choose Likud over Kadima.  The Yisrael Beiteinu (Israel Our Home) supports Likud in its attempt to form a government.  Kadima Leader Tzipi Livni would not join in a unity government with Likud that the Israel President was attempting to broker between the three largest parties.
 Kadima had won a plurality of the seats (28) in Knesset, the Israel parliament, in the February 10th election beating out the right-wing Likud Party by one seat.  Livini met with Beiteinu party leader Avigdor Lieberman in an attempt to form the core of an new coalition government.  Kadima was expecting to be able to form a government with Labor (13 seats), Meretz and New Movement (3 seats) and Beiteinu (15 seats).  This coalition would have 59 seats, but now without Beiteinu only 44 seats making either combination 2 seats or 17 seats short of a majority.
 Beiteinu won 15 seats in the election — the third most seats — making it key to the make up of the government.  It ran on a plank of loyalty oaths to Israel from Israel's Arab citizens or have their citizens lost.  The initial government coalition of Likud and Beiteinu combined has 44 seats just 19 seats short of a majority.
 After official results are published (on February 18, in this election), the President of Israel delegates the task of forming a government to the member of Knesset with the best chance of assembling a majority coalition (usually the leader of the largest party.) That designee has up to 42 days to negotiate with the different parties, and then present his government to the Knesset for a vote of confidence. Once the government is approved (by a vote of at least 61 members), the coalition leader becomes Prime Minister.
 Netanyahu will reach out to Kadima first after the announcement of his selection as possible Prime Minister.  He will extend several key cabinet position to Kadima.  Also, he will be contacting the Labor Party as a possible coalition partner.  During the election campaign, Netanyahu stated that not forming a national-unity government when we was previously Prime Minister was a mistake.
 According to Netanyahu's associates, they expect that it is likely that neither Kadima nor Labor will join a Lukid led coalition government.   A right-wing government of 65 seats with Shas (11 seats) as the third party is expected.
 Peres consulted with 10 of 12 parties with seats in Knesset. Parties with the total of 65 seats recommend Netanyahu to lead the next government.  Besides Likud and Beiteinu, Habayit Hayehudi, Shas, National Union and United Torah Judaism indicated a preference for Netanyahu.  Other parties (Meretz, Balad, Labor, Hadash and the United Arab List-Ta'al) made no suggestion.
 Labor chairman and Defense Minister Ehud Barak indicated Thursday that the Labor is preparing to operating as part of the opposition to the government.  He also indicated that Tzipi Livni was not recommended to the President due to the deal that she offered to Our Home.
 The choice of Netanyahu has not encouraged Palestinian officials.  Netanyahu has been on the record as saying that he supports settlement expansion and believes that negotiations with Palestine are a waste of time.  Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has said that there will be no negotiation as long as settlement expansion continues.  Furthermore the coalition between Likud and Avigdor Lieberman's party would be a huge blow to the Palestinian's mainly because of Lieberman's refusal to negotiate the question of whether or not to divide the city of Jerusalem, a city which Palestinians have hoped to make their capital for a Palestinian state.

 As a result of Yesh Atid winning 19 seats in the Knesset, Lapid has been approached by both Netanyahu to form a governing party and by Shelly Yachimovich from the left-wing Israeli Labor Party to join an opposition alliance. Yesh Atid supports changing the law to remove the exemptions ultra-Orthodox Jews have from mandatory military service, a move which along with economic reforms to support the middle class they dubbed ""sharing the burden"".
 Yachimovich invited Yesh Atid ""to form a coalition of moderate, social, peace advocate and centrist forces without Benjamin Netanyahu as PM"". Yesh Atid have rejected that offer, with Yair Lapid saying that they will not join an ""obstructive bloc"".

Carney also laid out the White House view on how to deal with Palestine: ""We believe that what needs to take place is direct negotiations between the two parties (Israelis and Palestinians) that addresses the final-status issues and results in a two-state solution"".

Shapiro said the US ""looks forward to working closely with next government of Israel.""

"," Sharansky’s resignation as Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Jerusalem was accepted by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at Sunday’s cabinet meeting.
 “I believe [the Gaza withdrawal] is a tragic plan that makes us pay an extremely high price for nothing, and also encourages terror,” Sharansky said. “The only aim of the current government is the implementation of the disengagement plan, and therefore it is wrong, even immoral, for me to remain a part of this government.”
 Sharansky said that although he was always against what he calls the “so-called disengagement plan,” he decided to leave the government once the battle against the withdrawal was no longer able to be waged from within the government. “Our main battle now is public opinion, because the struggle in the government is finished,” he said.
 Although he hopes to take the struggle to the people, the former minister hopes his move will pave the way for other politicians to follow their consciences. “I don’t know how effective my quitting will be,” Sharansky said, “but I hope it will encourage other politicians and ministers to at least vote according to what they believe and what they think.”
 The former prisoner of Zion (who served time in a Soviet prison for wanting to emigrate to Israel) says his main objection to the plan to withdraw from Gaza and northern Samaria is the fact that the withdrawal is not contingent on the creation of democracy within the Palestinian Authority. “I have promoted the spread of democracy as the only answer for thirty years. And now, at the time when an American president declares these principles and promotes them, an Israeli PM comes along and does the exact opposite.”
 Although he has in the past supported withdrawal from parts of the land of Israel, Sharansky says the current plan goes too far. “We cannot control another people and we will need serious compromise, but that compromise does not include giving another people the ability to destroy us... as if we run from Gaza, Gaza will not run after us.”
 Sharansky, whose Yisrael B’Aliyah party merged with the ruling Likud party after last elections, has maintained good relations with Sharon. “I had many opportunities to present my point of view to the Prime Minister, both publicly and privately,” Sharansky said. “He believes the withdrawal will give us ten years free from world pressure during which to build the settlement blocs of Gush Etzion, Maaleh Adumim and Ariel. I told him we will not have ten years – we will not even have ten days free from pressure, because we are legitimizing one-sided withdrawals from Jewish areas – each withdrawal will only invite more pressure.”
 “We are speaking about three generations of Jews that were sent on the important mission by the Israeli government and made an empty desert into a blossoming garden. Now we will just destroy all these beautiful communities, with their unique agriculture and incredible Judaism - for what?” Sharansky asks.
 “For nothing,” he added, “as a reward for terrorism.”

 Rents in Tel Aviv are said to have risen by over 60 percent in four years. Buying costs have soared too, with estate agent Eli Melloul stating that the average price for an Israeli apartment has now reached 1 million shekels ($295,000).

 Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert also referred to Iran in his remarks at Yad Vashem. ""You wish to deny the right of existence of the Jewish state, and you are wrong to believe that the Jewish state was created only due to the Holocaust. The Holocaust only underscored the necessity of its creation and the horrible price that the Jewish people had to pay for the lack of existence of a state that can shelter them,"" said Olmert. Other speakers at Yad Vashem emphasized the importance of the Israel Defense Forces, Israel's military forces, to prevent tragedies such as the Holocaust in the future. 
 Lieutenant General Gabi Ashkenazi, military chief of staff of Israel, led an annual march of Jewish youths, Poles and survivors at Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland, in a memorial ceremony called The March of the Living. Auschwitz-Birkenau operated as a Nazi death camp during the Holocaust. 12,000 people gathered from 52 countries to take part in the memorial ceremony. The largest march took place in 2005, and former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon joined with 20,000 people. ""... in these days, as we celebrate 60 years of independence, the fact that an independent Jewish state exists is not something to be taken for granted. Even today, we hear the horrible sounds of those who call for the destruction of the state of Israel. Even today we are forced to continue and fight for our right to have a national home in a safe place for the Jewish people in their own land. We have learned our lesson and we take very seriously the threats of state leaders who call for the destruction of Israel,"" said Ashkenazi.
 Hamas television Thursday suggested that the Holocaust was organized by Jews to wipe out the disabled among their own people to prepare for the creation of a Jewish state. ""The Israeli Holocaust - the whole thing was a joke, and part of the perfect show that (Zionist leader and future Israeli prime minister) Ben Gurion put on,"" said head of the Palestinian Centre for Strategic Research Amin Dabur, according to Jerusalem-based Palestinian Media Watch. Dabur said that the ""young energetic and able"" went to Israel, and that those who were disabled were sent ""so there would be a Holocaust"". 
 Though Iran has said that its nuclear program is peaceful in nature, the United States, Israel, and other countries believe it is attempting to construct nuclear weapons. In speeches Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said that the Jewish state should be destroyed. Ahmadinejad has called the Holocaust ""a myth"". Tehran hosted a revisionist Holocaust conference in 2006, which provoked international criticism. Tel Aviv University published a study on Monday saying that acts of anti-Semitism in 2007 increased by about seven percent over 2006.

"," Leaders from around the world have congratulated re-elected U.S. President Barack Obama on his success at the ballot box.
 Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu stated that he ""will continue to work with President Obama to preserve the strategic interests of Israel's citizens"" and described relations between the U.S. and Israel as ""rock solid"". Some others within the ruling Likud party were not so optimistic about the relationship, with Knesset member Danny Danon criticising Obama for ""ill-advised"" policies towards Israel and hoping Obama ""resets his course relating to Israel and our region for the next four years"".
 A statement on behalf of Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas expressed hope that Obama ""continues his efforts to achieve peace in the Middle East"".
 The British Prime Minister David Cameron took time from his tour of the Middle East to congratulate Obama and listed as shared priorities a trade deal between the U.S. and the United Kingdom as well as solving the crisis in Syria. Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, stated on Twitter that Obama's success in the election was ""based on building fairer economy and optimism about what politics can achieve.""
 French leader François Hollande said in choosing Obama over Mitt Romney, voters in the United States had voted for ""an America of openness and solidarity, fully engaged on the international scene and conscious of the challenges facing our planet: peace, economy and the environment"". He listed economic growth, unemployment, and the Middle East as challenges the two politicians would have to face. German leader Angela Merkel stated she ""deeply appreciated"" meetings and conversations with Obama on issues including ""overcoming the global financial and economic crisis"".
 Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, and Jose Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, issued a joint statement which described the U.S. as ""a key strategic partner of the European Union"" and hoped to meet Obama ""at an early date in order to reconfirm our priorities and provide renewed impetus to our joint action"".
 Across Africa, Obama received congratulations from South African President Jacob Zuma, Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, and Raila Odinga, the Prime Minister of Kenya.

"," Although the Supreme Court reportedly annulled recent election results on March 24, two rival parliaments have been meeting in the Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek. The Central Election Commission of Kyrgyzstan voted to endorse the legitimacy of the newly elected and protested parliament on Saturday. 
 Both a pre-election chamber, comprising of an upper and lower house, and a post-election chamber, comprising of single house, met in separate rooms of the parliament building on Saturday. MPs from both parliaments are set to meet and debate how to proceed. Among solutions proposed are keeping both parliaments functioning until the next election.
 ""Our opinion is that we should be the legitimate lawmakers because the people have chosen us,"" said Roman Shin, who was elected to the new parliament. He said the MPs of the former parliament, which were meeting once again, ""don't want to abandon power."" 
 ""The revolution was made by [only] 5,000 people,"" he said, and added that he and his allies could organize at least five times as many.
 ""It all happen so fast, we don't even know if we can call it a revolution,"" Felix Kulov, newly appointed head of security ministries, told UPI. ""We still haven't figured out what happened. People just ran into the White House and the president fled the country. It was not planned. It was not a revolution. But now we have to take control somehow.""
 Hundreds of protesters rushed into the Kyrgyz parliament demanding a meeting with acting President Kurmanbek Bakiyev on Saturday, according to a RIA Novosti correspondent. 
 They demanded that the newly elected parliament be declared illegitimate. Bakiyev promised that he'd settle the matter within two weeks, and the protesters were reportedly not satisfied by his assurances.
 Eight of ten members of the Central Election Commission of Kyrgyzstan voted to acknowledge the protested results of the last election as legitimate. Earlier this week, the Supreme Court declared the election results annulled.
 ""The decision of the Supreme Court is illegal as it was made under pressure of the crowd. After the announcement of the registration results the Central Election Commission can hold a session, for instance, tomorrow,"" a newly elected MP, Alisher Sabirov, told RIA Novosti. 
 On Saturday the upper house of the former parliament said it would preserve its authorities before the June 26 presidential elections and did not acknowledge the new parliament.
 Leaders of key political structures signed a compromise memorandum on the March 25. The memorandum states that the former parliament will continue to serve until April 14. After that, the new parliament will take over.
 However, quite a few MPs are doubting the legitimacy of the March 25 memorandum. They are demanding that the former, two-house parliament's tenure be extended. The more radical MPs are demanding that the new parliament, or ""imposters,"" must leave the parliament building. They contend that the memorandum must be revised.
 The lower house of parliament is also rumored to be discussing the possibility of declaring a state of emergency, behind closed doors.
 Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who was elected both acting president and prime minister, also appointed new ministers on Friday. Among the newly-appointed ministers are Myktybek Abdyldayev, former chief prosecutor who had been fired by deposed president Askar Akayev on Wednesday, as interior minister, Felix Kulov as minister of security, and Rosa Otunbayeva as minister of foreign affairs.
 The ministers were appointed as acting ministers and thus did not need the approval of the upper house of parliament.
 The former parliament also scheduled Kyrgyz presidential elections for June 26. This announcement was met by MPs with applause. 
 ""I think I should run in the presidential elections. God willing, I will,"" Bakiyev said.
 Adding to the uncertainty, deposed president Askar Akayev has said that he has not resigned and intends to return to the country. However, Bakiyev and Kulov both said that there were no grounds for impeaching or persecuting Akayev.
 ""The vote of no confidence takes place in case of high treason or after initiation of criminal proceedings. So far, we have no evidence of either,"" Kulov said in an interview on national television.
 ""I have no intention of persecuting Askar Akayev. He has done much for democracy and building a sovereign Kyrgyzstan,"" Bakiyev told reporters.
 Bakiyev reportedly met with the U.S. ambassador to Kyrgyzstan and discussed the situation with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the telephone. Putin reportedly offered the county Russia's help.
 Bakiyev appealed to the staff of deposed President Akayev and Prime Minister Tanayev's offices to report back to work. ""We must re-establish order in the White House,"" Bakiyev said.

 Lawlor was on a trip in the Russian capital and was making his way to the airport with his driver and a Ukrainian interpreter. The woman, who sustained serious injuries, survived the crash. The driver of the automobile was also killed.
 Lawlor resigned from poltics and his position as a Teachta Dála in the Irish house of parliament (the Dáil) after he admitted receiving sums of money from the lobbyist Frank Dunlop.  After Fianna Fáil conducted its own internal investigation, Lawlor resigned from the Party, however he continued to support the government in the Dáil. Lawlor appeared at the Tribunal on several occasions and was imprisoned in Mountjoy Prison for non-compliance with the investigation.
 Previous untrue allegations that the Ukrainian woman was a call girl have led to the Irish Independent newspaper issuing a formal apology to Mr Lawlor's Family.  Reports that Lawlor was in possession of the drug PCP were likewise proved to be false.

"," Leo Varadkar, Ireland's Health Minister, introduced emergency legislation in the lower house of the Irish parliament yesterday evening, to negate the legal loophole created by a decision from Dublin's Court of Appeal that morning. Various hard drugs — including ketamine, ecstasy, and magic mushrooms — were rendered legal, following the law governing their prohibition being found to be unconstitutional.
 The drug possession case of Stanislav Bederev led to the legal loophole; his lawyers arguing the 2010 addition of several drugs to the country's controlled substances list, governed by the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, was unlawful. They contended it was unconstitutional to add these substances to the list without consulting the Oireachtas — i.e., parliament.
 The Irish government is stressing the urgency of parliamentary legislation to rectify the situation. ""It is now important from both a public health and criminal justice perspective that the legislation be enacted as soon as possible"", said a government spokesperson. The Health Minister expressed concern both for the welfare of individuals taking advantage of the temporary legality of the substances involved, and for drug-related convictions handed down since the now-unconstitutional changes came into effect.
 ""The emergency legislation I am introducing today will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment"", said Mr Varadkar.

"," An Garda Síochána have regained control in Dublin, Ireland following riots in which a Republican counter-demonstration against Loyalist marches in the city descended into violence that engulfed the city centre. Shops on some of Dublin's major thoroughfares including O'Connell Street, Nassau Street and Kildare Street were closed as the Garda Riot Squad moved in from Grafton Street, and hundreds of shoppers were caught up in the disturbance. 
 40 protesters have been arrested, and 14 people have been hospitalised, including RTÉ News main correspondent Charlie Bird, and six gardaí. 13 of the arrested will be dealt with tonight during a special sitting of Dublin District Court.
 The riots, which have been described as the worst that Dublin has seen in a quarter of a century, broke out at 12.45 pm. About 1,000 Loyalist protestors, including members of the Orange Order, had travelled from Northern Ireland in order to march from Parnell Street down to Leinster House (the seat of the Irish parliament) on Kildare Street. 
 The march never got underway, however; the protesters were transported to the location by bus following a consultation with gardaí that suggested a march would be unsafe. The march was intended to commemorate victims of Republican paramilitary activity. 
 Loyalist protesters proceeded to demonstrate outside Leinster House for a short time, but the parade was cancelled as around 300 Republican protestors from across Ireland moved onto Kildare Street. Gardaí ordered major premises to shut as the violence increased. Missiles, fireworks, petrol bombs, and rubble and tools from a building site on O'Connell Street were thrown by Republican protestors onto gardaí. As the rioting proceeded, looting broke out, the Loyalist protesters were advised to leave the region, and cars were burned out between Kildare Street and O'Connell Street.
 Political figures, led by President of Ireland Mary McAleese, and including leaders of major political parties from across Ireland's political spectrum such as Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Irish Labour Party, Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic Labour Party have condemned the violence. Taoiseach Bertie Ahern has commented that ""It is the essence of Irish democracy and republicanism that people are allowed to express their views freely and in a peaceful manner. People who want only to attack gardaí and property have no respect for their fellow citizens."" 
 Unionist politicians due to participate in the rally, including Democratic Unionist Party MP Jeffrey Donaldson and Ulster Unionist deputy leader Danny Kennedy, have issued a complaint to the Irish Minister for Justice Michael McDowell, who has admitted that An Garda Síochána were not expecting the level of hostility that was realised. Mr McDowell has also commented that the riots were perpetrated by people who did not understand what Irish republicanism means and who have damaged the cause of Irish unity that they purported to support.
 Republican Sinn Féin, a party which split from the main body of Sinn Féin in 1986 and which had been involved in the organisation of the counter-demonstration, have declared that it was irresponsible for the authorities to allow the marches to go ahead. It is believed that around €50,000 will be necessary to clear up and repair the damage caused to O'Connell Street, Dublin's main thoroughfare, and the street will remain closed until tomorrow. It is feared that the riots will have a significant impact on the Northern Ireland peace process, and on plans by the Irish government to recommence annual commemorations of the 1916 Easter Rising.

"," Wikinews correspondent J.J. Liu spoke with Technological University Dublin (TUD) senior lecturer at the School of Surveying & Construction Management, Dr Lorcan Sirr on Friday regarding the supply of housing in the Republic of Ireland and relevant parallels across the rest of Europe, as well as recent developments by the government and private sector that are causing a rise in rents and home prices in the Irish real estate market.
 Dr Sirr is a regular contributor to The Irish Times and has provided commentary to Irish radio station Newstalk, national broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) and various other publications.  In addition to being a chartered planning and development surveyor and assessor to the Society of Chartered Surveyors, Dr Sirr is a Peace Commissioner and former external examiner for the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, according to his profile on Worky.
 Dr Sirr was a lecturer and former head of research for the Faculty of the Built Environment at the Dublin Institute of Technology, which entered a merger with two partner institutes to become TUD January 1, 2019.  He received his bachelor's degree in estate management at the University of Greenwich, United Kingdom, and master's degree in urban design and PhD in town planning at the University of Manchester.  He has a second master's in literature from KU Leuven, Belgium, and speaks French.
 By most measures, Ireland is a far wealthier country than it was decades ago, yet the cost of rent and owning one's own home has been steadily on the rise.  A Q1 Daft.ie price report found the average monthly rent in Ireland is up to EUR1443.  Broadly speaking, to what do you attribute this to?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  One of the main reasons for rents rising significantly over the last decade has been the increased use of the rental sector for social housing.  So, social housing is typically housing that's provided by the state for people that can't afford their own housing.  And traditionally what has happened is that the state builds houses for people who need housing.  And increasingly, they've not been doing that, but instead they've been placing families who need housing into the rental sector.
 So, what they're doing there is, they're putting a lot more demand into the rental sector, constraining supply, and then rents are going up.  So, if we got rid of the government's practice of using the private rental sector for state housing or for social housing, you would find that there's a lot more supply available, and that is a huge driver of rents.
 The other driver of rents, of course, has been that, about four years ago, the government introduced a new system whereby rents could be increased annually up to a maximum of 4%, but of course when you introduce a maximum, the maximum quickly becomes the target.  So, every landlord just increase[s] their rent by 4% every year.  So over a number of years 4% on 4% on 4% on 4% adds up to significant rental increases.
 ((WN))  Now, you're saying, 'the 4% the 4% the 4%', I know the [government] opposition, Social Democrats and Sinn Féin, even before the [COVID-19] pandemic, they've been advocating for a temporary, I believe, ban on rent increases, or just a rent-freeze overall.  Do you think that would help the situation?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  It depends on what you mean by 'the situation'.  It would help tenants, without a doubt, it would help tenants in situ, because suddenly they'd have a rent-freeze and their rents would be stuck where they are.
 Whether it would benefit the sector overall is a different thing—whether it's constitutional is a third thing—but, so, it would benefit tenants.  Would it benefit the system overall?  If landlords aren't able to make a return on their rents, there is an increased chance that the landlords will leave the sector.  Now, the house is still there, but the house will go for home ownership or for something else.  So, you know, at a more macro[economic]-level, maybe that wouldn't be the best thing to happen.
 And the third issue is that constitutionally there has been a court case in 1982, Blake [v.] the Attorney General, which said that rent-freezes, per se, are unconstitutional.  So, you're beginning to trickle in legal ground by doing something like that.  Having said that, what they've brought in—it happened today, actually; [it] comes into effect today—is rents are now linked to the European harmonised price; basically inflation.  And that happens, today.
 ((WN))  Daft.ie relates the COVID-19 pandemic to the situational cession of construction activity and the second-hand market.  Do you expect these variables to change in the coming weeks and months?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Funnily enough, last year, you know, we had built 21 thousand houses in 2019, and we kind of thought that last year, because of COVID[-19], we might get 12 or 13 thousand houses: these are really small numbers, like.  But we got 20 thousand houses, I think 20 thousand houses in the last year, which was really surprising, it was nearly the same as the year before.  So, COVID[-19] didn't really stop that much housebuilding activity.  It didn't really have the change, the impact that we thought it was going to have.
 Yeah, the construction industry are quite [fortunate] that construction sites [are] open-air, should be allowed to be open and remain open, and they kind of won their case a lot of the time.  But, the other thing is like, do we expect these variables to change in the next months?  I don't think we'll ever see.  You have a lot of people out there who say we need 33 thousand houses a year, 48 thousand houses a year, whatever, all that numbers.
 The market isn't going to supply more houses than it can sell, and over the last four or five years it has been selling the same number of houses every year: about seven or eight thousand houses.  Out of the 20 thousand houses, only about seven or eight thousand come on the market for sale for ordinary people.  And that's about right, that's about the level where prices are stabilising, at seven or eight [thousand].  If they build any more houses, sales prices will fall because they've increased the supply.  And so, I think builders are quite clever and that, no matter what happens with COVID[-19], right, I still think we're only going to churn out 20, 22, 24 thousand houses every year.  Because if they churn out any more than that, they're going to oversupply the market — and negatively impact the sales price.  So they're very clever about maintaining, drip-feeding the market like that.
 ((WN))  Speaking of the prices, residential property prices rose by 4.5% the year to April, in a range from 0.5% in apartments in Dublin to 8.5% in houses on the border with the North [of Ireland; Northern Ireland], according to the Central Statistics Office.  Do you expect this to change as post-pandemic consumer price inflation—European harmonised inflation—eases more broadly?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Well, you've got to remember the places like the Border, Midlands and western region that you're referring to now with the 8.5%, they are starting from a really low base.  So 8.5% is coming from something very low, so it's 8.5% of something low anyway, so [in] those areas, 8.5% doesn't scare me at all.  It's more in the large cities, or, we don't really have large cities, but in the cities, our price rise is moderating.
 And the interesting thing that's driving the sales prices outside Dublin is COVID[-19], and the idea that a lot of people have decided that, ""instead of living in a city, and now that we can work from home, I'm going to move back to [the] Border, Midlands, wherever I'm from originally where I can buy or get free land and buy a big house that I could never buy or build in Dublin, blah blah blah, and do that"".  And that's driving prices, with the people moving to other areas.
 How long that will last is the other question.  I don't know: I think a lot of employers will want a return at some stage, but I think we haven't fully thought out this idea [of] working from home, I think we're only [in the] very early stages of it.  So I'm not sure of those price rises will sustain themselves over the next few years.  I think there could be a moment of excitement at the moment, where people are going: ""oh great, I can get out of the city, I can buy a cheaper house back in the countryside, and I'll do that"", but, you know, pretty soon I think people will realise they want to be back in the city, or the excitement will wear off of that, and only a certain number of people do that, and the rest of the people stay in the cities.
 ((WN))  What are your thoughts on the government's Rebuild[ing] Ireland initiative?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Rebuilding Ireland was the government policy from 2016 until this year, actually, last month.  So it's finished now, it failed.  It had five main pillars, like reusing stock, ending homelessness, all that stuff.  It failed on all the pillars.  It didn't hit any of its targets, and one of the problems with it was that it was very simplistic in many ways, and very much driven by quantity over quality.  So, it was all about numerical targets, and it didn't matter if the houses that were built under these numerical targets were connected with public transport, they had local infrastructure, they had services et cetera, et cetera.  That didn't matter, that was secondary; the most important part was to get numbers of houses up, you know, get those numbers, hit those targets.
 So, very simplistic.  We're [a] first-world country, we're quite a wealthy country.  We should be doing better planning than, you know, the target is 25 thousand houses a year, let's hit 25 thousand, and it doesn't matter if they're not serviced by public transport, it doesn't matter if they're not sustainable development, it doesn't matter if they're in areas where they're not needed.  You know, it was very much targets-driven, which is why it failed.
 So, it failed on all their targets.  So, you know, you need it better.  We have a national planning policy that's telling us to do one thing in a kind of more correct, best-practice way, and then you have a Rebuilding Ireland housing strategy that's telling us to throw up houses everywhere as quickly as we can, and the two things do not compute, they're not compatible, you know.  So we ended up with this mess, you know, as always.
 ((WN))  So you're saying that the numerical strategy is not the best approach.  I don't know if you've had the chance to read this, but [on] 14 July the government published its Summer Economic Statement and it's included a promise for a Housing for All strategy that's ""designed to boost housing outputs"".  So, what do you think is most crucial in pursuing that aim, if not strictly numerical?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  There's no point in building houses if it means that people are living far away from employment, for example, because you're building houses, but yet you're creating other pressures on traffic and congestion and forced car ownership and a whole lot of other issues.  So, you know, it's not about the numbers, and in any event, one of the problems with these strategies is that it's one thing to have a numerical target if I have control over the numbers that are going to be delivered, because I am the state.
 The problem with the Irish state is that it relies nearly entirely on the private market to deliver its housing output targets.  You can't control the free market, you know, the market will do what it wants to do, so even though we might need 30, 40, 50 thousand houses a year, if the market decides that 20 thousand houses is the optimal level, that's all they're gonna build.  And the state can't force them to build 40 thousand, so one of the problems with Rebuilding Ireland and having a targets-driven system is that targets are fine if you are in control of the delivery of the targets, but targets are pointless if you're relying on someone else to deliver those targets for you.  And that was where we went wrong with that.
 So I think, with the new Housing for All strategy, I haven't seen it, and I know there's arguments in the government about how much money should be allocated towards it, but I mean really, if it's going to achieve what it wants to achieve, the state needs to take far more control over the delivery of housing.  Because if you don't have control over it, you lose control over quality, you lose control over costs, you lose control over timing, and by relying on the market, these are all lessons that we know from 20 years ago, but we're a bit dumb in that we don't, kind of, learn the lessons that we should be learning.
 So we're back again relying on the market, and then, you know, you just lose control over everything.
 ((WN))  What would you recommend the government do then, for its Housing for All strategy?  It hasn't been published yet, but what would you personally think would be best, just in trying to solve [through] the strategy?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Yeah, I think we already have a lot of lands and we already have a lot of vacant housing in Ireland.  We have an incredibly high rate of vacant housing, and the government seems to be reluctant to tackle either land that we have — a lot of land owned by the state itself, not even private land — and the reuse of existing housing.  Like, we don't even tax people who leave properties empty, for example.  I could leave my house in Dublin for ten years and nobody would tax me, nobody would say anything to me.  And that's crazy, you know, when you have a housing shortage, like how could you let people leave their houses empty in a housing shortage?  But we do!  We can, in Ireland.  There's no way to, kind of, penalise people for doing that.
 And we don't charge property tax really, we don't charge a meaningful property tax.  So we're very reluctant to interfere with people's ownership of property and people's usage of property.  So, we have land, and we have a lot of empty housing.  I think really what has been happening over the last ten years is an increased centralisation over the control of the delivery of housing, so in other words, taking away power from local government—we have very weak local government anyway, like councils and town councils—and bringing it back to a centralised government department.
 Really, what needs to happen is responsibility for the delivery of housing needs to go back to a local level, and put responsibility on councillors and mayors and people like that to deliver housing, not having it done from a central office up in Dublin.
 ((WN))  What are your thoughts on the Affordable Housing Bill [2021], which was defended by the Fianna Fáil Minister [for] Housing[, Local Government and Heritage] Darragh O'Brien as ""empowering local authorities to deliver affordable homes [for] purchase on their own lands""?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Yeah, it's kind of interesting because it's doing the opposite of what I was talking about, like.  So I'm, you know, saying ""give more power back to councils"", and at the same time the Minister is taking power away from councils on the disposal of land.  He's, you know, forcing councils to give up good land they have zoned for housing to a centralised body, and really it's the opposite that needs to happen.
 A lot of the affordable housing stuff still brings in the private sector.  And when you're bringing in the private sector you're bringing in profit, and the more you bring in, the less affordable the housing becomes, because the private sector has to make a profit, that's understandable.  Well, unless you're kind of willing to do it yourself, then you need to use the private sector and the affordability comes out the window.  So really, what the government's been urged to do by opposition and even by its own internal members is to borrow, at a time like now when money is quite cheap to borrow, to borrow more money and build housing ourselves, and forget the private sector.  Let the private sector look after the private sector, and let the state look after the state.
 But we've mixed up the two for so many years now that we're finding it hard to disentangle ourselves from our reliance on the state.
 ((WN))  The Residential Tenancies Act [2021] which, as you said, comes into effect today, it ensures that the rent pressure zones can increase with the consumer prices.  It has been challenged by the opposition obviously, just because they think that it's unfair on tenants, and that sort of thing.  What are your thoughts?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Well actually, a lot of the opposition people were in favour, I know Sinn Féin were very much in favour of an inflation rate-related rent change system.  I mean, I think it's better than the current system: when you set an upper limit, a ceiling, of what rents can go, so in our case it was 4%, that just becomes a target for landlords.  So landlords go, ""well, the most I can increase it by is 4%, so I'm just going to increase it to 4%"", and everybody does, and then rents go up, and suddenly that's the market rent, so the next year you can increase your rent by another 4%, and the rents all go up and up by 4%.
 Look, when you have an inflation one, at least it's more broadly related to your expenditure on everything, and it should take some of the sting.  Now, having said that, inflation has been rising over the last few years, so what I would have liked to have seen would have been inflation, related as it is as of today, inflation-related rent increases, but with a cap of, say, two-and-a-half or three per cent on it.  I would have liked to see that, because if inflation does take off, and say we get 6% inflation, then we're in a worse position than we were before when it was only 4%.
 But in principle, I think I would be supportive of inflation[-related] rent increases.  And I think most of the opposition would be too.
 ((WN))  You wrote in The Sunday Times on 24 July, 2016 on the obsolete housing rate ""[h]ousing policy deserves a better evidential basis.""  Could you speak more to this?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  What I meant with that was, for a start, we didn't know how many houses we were counting every year.  We're very bad at data, so we didn't know how many houses we were building every year, we couldn't count them.  We didn't really know how many empty houses we had, and we didn't know [of] how many obsolete houses.  So, obsolete.  So, we have houses that we live in, we have empty houses like vacant houses, so, I'm away on holidays and my house in Dublin at the moment is empty, that's a vacant house, and then we have obsolete houses.
 So, obsolete houses are houses that are, effectively, uninhabitable.  Houses that we have let fall into a huge state of disrepair, so that nobody can live in them: so there's no water, no electricity.  It's just, you know, windows, no rooms, whatever.  And we have a huge problem with that.  Our rate of obsolescence is about four times the international norm, so we're letting an awful lot of buildings that could be potentially reused go un-reusable, if you know what I mean.
 We're letting them fall down.  [The computer is moved to the outside of his building.]  You see this building here?  That is part of an old farm, and that was a building that was almost obsolete, and the people spent some, borrowed some money and refurbished it, and now they rent it out on Airbnb or whatever.  [The computer is brought back inside.]  And that's the way to do it, like.  It's a perfectly good building, it's a beautiful building.  It's huge and it's really nice and it's really well-done, and, like, we have thousands of houses every year that we let fall into a state that they can't be reused.  And we didn't know how many we were doing it [to].
 So, in other words, we have a potential stock of housing that we're just letting rot and letting fall away, and that's what I was talking about in The Sunday Times, that we need to capture that data about how many houses that we're letting fall obsolete, and get a strategy to reuse them, and to, kind of, bring them back to life.  Because not everybody wants a new building, and you can't rely on builders to build every new building, you know, all the new buildings we need.  So, we also need to sort of capitalise on our existing housing stock.
 ((WN))  And who do you think should be held responsible for fixing these dilapidated buildings?  Do you think it should be the private sector and the private people or the local government or the national government?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  I think it's not really a kind of a punishment exercise, if you know what I mean.  I think this is probably a situation where a lot of people will have, say, you know, an example, this area I'm in, there's a farm next door and they own this building.  Maybe they didn't have the money, maybe some farmers, maybe some people who own obsolete or derelict buildings don't have the money to do it.  So I think there should be probably a process whereby we can give them a grant, and help them bring the buildings back to use, and then, you know, over 40 years they can repay the loan or repay the grant or whatever.
 But I think it can't be just a punishment, we can't just tax people for letting buildings fall out, I think we need to help them bring them back in use again, as well.  So, carrot and stick.
 ((WN))  You wrote again in The Sunday Times that September, and in fact, we've actually been talking a bit right now about, you know, Dublin and the cities, the government under the Taoiseach Enda Kenny has been focusing too much ""on crowd-pleasing, anti-urban policies that can never work"" with regards to its growth centres and housing supports.  What are some policy ideas you think could work in, you know, de-incentivising that sort of thing?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Yeah, so traditionally Ireland has been a fairly rural country, you know, and rural issues have dominated politics in Ireland for a long, long time.  We didn't have cities like they did in the UK, so we didn't have an Industrial Revolution.  Like, in the UK they were building big cities in the 1830s, 1840s, 1850s like Manchester, Leeds, Birmingham and, you know, London grew and all those kinds of places.  We didn't have any of that!  Now, Belfast did, which is like 150 miles up the road, because that was part of the United Kingdom and Belfast grew a Victorian, industrial city, but Dublin never did.
 The Industrial Revolution bypassed us because we've had presidents and prime ministers who had no interest in cities.  We don't have an urban culture, you know.  We don't know how it is to manage a city, we don't even know what a big city really looks like, you know.  You come to Ireland and it's like, what we call cities, like, they're just towns, you know what I mean.  Like, the whole population of Ireland is just a suburb of somewhere in Singapore, you know what I mean.  The scale here is tiny, and we've never had an interest in, kind of, you know, in developing our cities and developing how they should work.  So, it's always been, kind of, the rural politicians have quite often got their way.
 And not only that, the people we've had managing places like Dublin have often been rural people, people from a rural background.  So they're not even city livers or city dwellers: they weren't born in the city, they don't know how it is to live in the city.
 So, you know, we've neglected our cities over the years.  And it's getting better, but we have neglected our cities over the years.  One of the things I think we could do is have directly-elected lord mayors, with powers over the police and over urban developments and things like that.  We don't do that, we don't do local government at all, and I think the most successful things, looking at European and international cities, is when they have strong local government, they have a directly-elected lord mayor, and if I don't like what the lord mayor has done in my city, I'm going to vote them out.  Whereas we don't have that here.  We have lord mayors, but they're nominal, they're kind of titular honorary kind-of positions; they have no power.  So, everything is determined by the civil servants, and quite often they are wrong.
 ((WN))  Going back to the whole housing supply [question], you know, do you think the government should focus on, you know, incentivising people to move out of Dublin, or starting new jobs outside of cities, or?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Yeah, I mean, for those who want it, absolutely.  I think we should, you know, if it takes pressure off big cities, absolutely help them, kind of, move.  But there's a caveat, and the caveat is: you don't let people move outside Dublin to live like where I am at the moment, which is a one-off house in the middle of the countryside, right.  And if I want to get a pint of milk or a newspaper, I have to get in my car outside, I have to drive five or ten kilometres to the shop, right, and then back here, okay?  That's crazy, it's not sustainable, you know, it's not economic, it's not clever.  So you can't let them do that, but I think if you let them move out of Dublin and into towns and villages, absolutely, why not?
 Repopulate the towns and villages, rather than let people live all over the place.
 ((WN))  The Dáil Éireann voted recently for an amendment to a bill that would impose a 10% stamp duty rate on 'sale and leaseback' or 'cuckoo funds' with an exception if they were purchased for the purpose of social housing.  Do you think this will have a noticeable impact on the number of units available?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  That's a really interesting question, because I think the stamp duty rate, like exempting the funds from the stamp duty rate, is just nonsense, absolutely nonsense.  These funds make so much money that paying the stamp duty will have no effect because when they're renting to the state, the state is the equivalent of having, you know, a blue chip tenant in your property, okay.  The state isn't going to default on the rent, the state will look after the property et cetera et cetera.
 So they're making so much money off the state, there was no need to cut the stamp duty.  Previously, nobody wanted the state as a tenant because they were like ""poor people in houses, we don't want them.""  Now, the investment funds have realised ""actually, having the state, having the local authorities and councils as a tenant to take 300 of my properties, that's a brilliant thing!  Because they'll always be full, they're going to guarantee me 95% of market rent, and they're going to look after the properties and they will never default on the rent.  The state will not default on the rent, so therefore, it's brilliant!""
 So as long as the state keeps doing the crazy stuff of renting properties rather than building properties, these funds will always come.  So [it] probably will increase supply, yeah, but it's a bonkers policy because it's like living on your credit cards, you know: you're constantly paying rent, and at the end of 25 years, you don't own the building.  So, it's kind of a crazy practice for the state to get into, but that's what they're into.
 ((WN))  What do you feel about such a large pre[valence] of international, or just large investment companies' presence in the Irish housing market, overall?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Yeah, I'm a bit worried about it because it's a smaller market, they have a disproportionate effect.  In a large country like Germany or, I don't know where you're from.  Where are you from?
 ((WN))  From [the United States of] America.
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  In [the United States of] America, a huge market, right?  Those funds are, like, so prevalent in the US and in Canada and places like that.  I'm quite concerned about them because they tend to have so much money that they can crowd out the small landlords.  In Ireland, the majority of our landlords are small landlords: ordinary people who happen to have a property that they rent out to somebody else.  Like 90% of our landlords are small, they're not these large funds.  I would be worried that these funds will come in, they'd crowd out the small landlords and they won't be competitive.
 They won't introduce competition into the market because they're top-end, and they're only interested in the expensive product, and they won't bring down prices because they're not bringing in competition.  I would rather they were, like in other countries in Spain and places, they're not allowed to be involved in the residential market.  I think that's the correct approach, really.
 ((WN))  What are the features of a 'stable' housing market and 'optimal' buying conditions, in your opinion?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  To be honest with you, I don't think there's such a thing as a stable housing market really.  You know, I've never known a market that's 'stable', not in housing.  There's so many various things; housing's not like stocks and shares, you know stocks and shares, they're pieces of paper.  Housing is always changing.
 The demand for housing is always fluctuating, the type of housing is always changing, our needs are always changing.  Other issues impact housing: employment, taxation, planning, zoning, that all impacts on housing.  So it's different to stocks and shares, which nothing affects really except the market demand.
 So I've never known a stable housing market, to be honest with you, but one of the things that causes the greatest amount of instability is the idea [in] Ireland and other countries like us, like the UK and Australia; we have a system called asset-based welfare, and that really means that the government will help you buy your house, and then you're looking after yourself.  So, my house is my asset.  In Ireland, each man, woman and child is worth something like USD180 thousand each, something like that, alright?  More than half of that is in housing, in real estate property.  So we rely on our property for our wealth.  So when your parents die or when your parents want to send you to university, they can borrow against the value of their house and send you to university, to get a loan based on the value of their house.
 So we're relying on our houses for our wealth.  In other countries, they rely on their housing for shelter.  Yeah?  I'm not talking about poor countries, I'm talking about a place like Belgium and things like that where the housing is not an asset, the housing is shelter, and like in time you sell the house, you don't make much money on it.  Here, we're constantly relying on making money from our housing, so in our heads we always want to see prices rise.  And that of course negatively affects everybody else, particularly young people who need to buy a house, so our approach to housing is one of, we know it's the wrong thing that we should be wanting our value [of] our property to rise, but yet, like, we all secretly want it because it means we're wealthier.
 And of course, you're doing nothing.  Like, the price rises in housing are not anything I've done to my house, it's just because demand in my area has gone up, you know?  So, it's kind of non-productive wealth, and it's bad to rely on it because we're always looking for things that would keep prices high and not lower them.
 ((WN))  Do you think there's any country Ireland can look to as a role model?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Every country except Ireland, I think, and maybe not the US.  I think, like, no country has it perfect to be honest with you, and every country that I've looked at in, housing has good sides and it has flaws.  I think there's probably more cities than countries that have done so; Vienna does it very well.  The city of Vienna is really well involved in the delivery of seven thousand apartments every year for citizens of Vienna, and they get them at a subsidised rent and it's, you know, it's much more affordable.
 Places like Copenhagen have also done quite well on housing co-operatives, where people get together to build their houses.  I think the Anglophone countries like Ireland, the US, Australia, New Zealand, we have a very similar system of asset-based welfare and that's totally unhealthy and that's why we have these booms and crashes and booms and crashes.  And unless we start taking the profit element or the asset element out of housing, we're always going to be like that.  
 So when you look at countries that don't have that kind of financialisation of housing, like the Danes and some of the Austrian cities, some German cities, some from the Swiss, you find a much more, this back to your previous question, a much more stable environment where the risks are in other parts of the economy, but not in housing.  Whereas with us, one of the major systemic risks to our economy is housing, and it shouldn't be.  Housing should be a given, housing should be just something that's there all the time like roads and electricity.  But in Ireland it's not, it's up and down and up and down and it's a major threat to the economy.
 ((WN))  Do you have any other comments on the state of the Irish housing market?
 ((Dr Lorcan Sirr))  Well, we often talk about the Irish housing market as being dysfunctional, right?  But I don't think there's any such thing as a 'functional' housing market.  There's just so many variables, there's so many human, you know, interactions with it.  The big variable now, of course, is the international money coming in that we can't control—well, we could control, but we're not controlling it.  So now not alone do we have supply and demand and wages and employment and planning and all those things affecting housing, now we can have Wall Street money coming in and effectively telling us what to do, and deciding rents, and so that's another, you know, it's part of globalisation, it's part of financialisation.
 So, we're kind of constantly leading ourselves down a path which is really hard to get out of.  And really what it's creating is kind of social inequity, because if you're a homeowner, you are increasingly getting more and more advantages over people who don't own homes, and of course homeownership perpetuates homeownership because, you know, when I die or when I'm older I'll be able to get a deposit together and help children buy their house, and they'll be able to help their children buy their houses.  Whereas if you're never a homeowner, you can't do that.  So [it] perpetuates social [in]equality.
 So, we need to look at housing in a much broader way than just economics and money, we need to look at housing much more holistically in terms of society, planning, demographics and so on.

"," On Thursday, Pakistan's parliament announced a bill has been passed against the practice of honour killing. Per the legislation, those convicted of honour killing would be imprisoned for 25 years to life.
 In the practice of honour killing, men had the right to kill a female relative deemed to have brought dishonour to the family. Thus, murderers could avoid death-for-death Qisas ((ar))Arabic: ‍retribution in kind by paying blood money according to Diyya ((ar))Arabic: ‍blood money in Shari'a law.
 The legislation, which was jointly approved by upper and lower parliament, allows the perpetrator to avoid the death penalty if the victim's family forgives him, but the convict still faces imprisonment.
 Last year, more than 1000 honour killing cases were reported in Pakistan. The legislation was presented as eliminating loopholes from past legislation against honour-killing.  Pakistani human rights activist Farzana Bari noted the judge has unrestricted power to choose whether the murder qualifies as honour killing.
 Asserting in parliament that 17,000 females in Pakistan have eloped since 2014, Conservative senator Hafiz Hamdulla later told the Associated Press, ""They are trying to impose Western culture over here. We will not allow [...] We will impose the law that our holy Quran and Sunnah say"".
 The parliament also passed an anti-rape law mandating a DNA test. According to Shari'a law, proof of rape calls for multiple eyewitnesses. According to the legislation, the rapist of a minor or disabled person would face life imprisonment or a death sentence.
 After the bill against honour killing was passed, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said, ""Women are the most essential part of our society and I believe in their empowerment, protection and emancipation.""

"," Early poll results have shown that the anti-Musharraf parties, Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League (N), are emerging as victorious. 
The early results also show that Pakistan Muslim League (Q), the party supporting Pervez Musharraf, has been defeated.
 Furthermore, the results for Pakistan's national assembly indicate that the Pakistan Peoples Party currently have a small lead with 78 seats, with Nawaz Sharif's party just behind with 72 seats. The party which wins the elections for the National Assembly will choose the Prime Minister of Pakistan.
 The elections had a slow start at 8 a.m. (0300 GMT), as fears of violence kept many voters away. To enforce security, the Pakistani police is backed up by some 80,000 troops. The BBC reported that 80 million people are eligible to vote, but many are expected to stay at home, largely because of fears about security. Authorities reported at least five explosions that had taken place on election day, all but one of which occurred near a polling area.

"," The National Assembly of Pakistan has elected Fahmida Mirza of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) as its first female speaker, weeks after the general elections which ousted President Pervez Musharraf's party and gave the PPP the most seats in Parliament.
 Mirza, a former medical doctor who has previously served three terms in the National Assembly, was the joint candidate of the PPP, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) (PML-N), the Awami National Party (ANP), and other allied parties. 
 She received 249 votes out of the 324 who were present. Her main rival candidate, Israr Tareen from the former ruling party Pakistan Muslim League (Q) (PML-Q), received only 70 votes.
 The result was announced by Chaudhry Amir Hussain, the outgoing speaker. ""Fahmida Mirza is declared to have been elected speaker of the National Assembly,"" he said, as other Parliament members pounded their desks in approval.
 ""This is my third tenure in the National Assembly and I believe it is time that we all work together to address the challenges facing the country,"" Mirza told reporters. ""I am sure we will be able to face these challenges with the support of parliamentarians, our people and Pakistani media.""
 Shah Mahmood Qureshi, a central PPP leader, said, ""The election of Fahmida Mirza as speaker will be a big step towards the empowerment of women in Pakistan.""
 Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi, parliamentary leader of the pro-Musharraf PML-Q, told Mirza, ""This is a big test and I hope that with the honour that Allah has bestowed upon you, you will be able to live up to expectations.""
 Later, in elections for the deputy speaker, PPP candidate Faisal Kundi defeated Khush Bakhat Shujaat of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, which is allied with the PML-Q.
 The coalition government headed by the PPP has yet to name a Prime Minister, but they are expected to announce their nomination in the next few days. Party insiders say the prime minister, who will be named by Benazir Bhutto's son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, will only hold office for a few months until Bilawal's father, Asif Ali Zardari, becomes eligible for the post.

"," MP3s for the people? The Pirate Party, a new Swedish political party first publicized in January, wants to legalize sharing music, movies, and other copyrighted content using the Internet.  What may seem like a doomed effort by a small group of idealists is attracting significant media attention, in part due to a recent police raid on The Pirate Bay, an extremely popular BitTorrent tracker (see Wikinews coverage). 
 The Pirate Bay allows people to download content listed in its database using the BitTorrent protocol (including the latest Hollywood movies or computer games) and has gained something of an international cult status, in part for its public and irreverent responses to legal threats received from copyright lawyers of major corporations.  The site was reopened days after the raid on Dutch servers (but is now back in Sweden again). Rickard Falkvinge, leader of the Pirate Party, argues that regardless of the legal outcome in the case, the web site demonstrates that copyright law in its current form is not sustainable.
 Adopting the moniker of the maligned ""Internet pirates"", the party argues for drastically limiting the scope and enforcement of copyright law, abolishing patent law, and protecting privacy in what it sees as a ""control and surveillance society"". The party is hoping to garner enough votes in the September election to become a small but important faction in the next Swedish parliament.  Rickard Falkvinge found some time in between interviews and party work to answer our questions.
 There are rumours that the Swedish government was indirectly acting on behalf of the U.S. MPAA in shutting down the site. Do you feel that your government is beholden to U.S. interests?
 Oh, the MPAA said so themselves in a press release, it's more than a rumor. Check their press release ""Swedish authorities sink Pirate Bay"". [Ed.: see below]
 And yes, this particular fact has caused something of an uproar in Sweden. It's widely believed that Swedish authorities were more or less ordered by a foreign power to act forcefully against an entity that was in, at worst, a legal gray area according to Swedish law.
 The raid must have boosted your recognition. How many members do you currently have, and how successful has your fundraising effort been so far?
 Our member count is at 6540, no, 6541, no wait, 6543... well, you get the picture. Our members register themselves on our website after paying the membership fee electronically, which helps reduce our admin load considerably.
 Fundraising brought in 108,000 SEK [Ed.: approx. 14,700 USD or 11,600 EUR], enough to buy 3 million ballots, which is some kind of at-least-we're-not-starving minimum. We're not full, but we're not starving, either. Following the raid on the Pirate Bay, we have received another 50K in donations. My sincere thanks to everybody who wants to help out; we are now looking into getting more ballots to make sure we don't run out on election day. (10 million ballots was our initial full-score aim.)
 Do you think you will be able to cover future expenses such as radio and television ads?
 Following the raid on the Pirate Bay, and our tripling of the member roster, we don't need advertising. We've been mentioned almost every news hour across all channels on national television in the last week.
 Also, the established parties have now started to turn, following our success. Parties representing almost half of the elected parliament are now describing today's copyright situation as not working. They still don't understand why, though, they are just echoing what we say without understanding what the words mean. We'll get around to teaching them — them and the voters alike.
 This might be hard for people not following the Swedish media to grasp, but we have made a big splash. Today, our Minister of Justice was quoted as saying that he's open to changes to copyright laws that would make file-sharing legal, with the headline ""Bodström (his name) flip-flops about file sharing."" Immediately underneath were the Pirate Party's comments to his suggestions. Let's take that again: when a minister makes a statement about file sharing, media calls us for comments, and publishes them next to that statement. That's how big we have become since the raid on the Pirate Bay.
 The Minister of Justice later denied having made that statement to the press that reported it.
 We will never be able to pay for television ads, the way I see it. Unless a very wealthy donor comes on stage. (If any such person is reading this, we have planned how to spend up to $375,000 in a cost-efficient way up until the elections, on the chance that donations appear. That spending does still not include any TV ads.)
 Are you aware of similar initiatives in other countries?
 Some are trying, but none have achieved the necessary momentum and critical mass that we have. We expect that momentum to happen once we get into Swedish Parliament and show that it can be done.
 [Ed.: A United States variant of the party was recently launched. See also: Intellectual property activism category on Wikipedia]
 The name ""Pirate Party"" seems to identify the party with what is currently defined as a crime: piracy of software, movies, music, and so on. Will a name like ""Pirate Party"" not antagonize voters, given that the label is so negatively used? How about potential allies abroad who argue for a more balanced copyright regime, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation or Creative Commons?
 Oh, it is a crime. That's the heart of the problem! The very problem is that something that 20% of the voters are doing is illegal by punishment of jail time. That's what we want to change. Where the established parties are saying that the voters are broken, we are saying it's the law that is broken.
 Besides, it's a way of reclaiming a word. The media conglomerates have been pointing at us and calling us pirates, trying to make us somehow feel shame. It doesn't work. We wear clothes saying ""PIRATE"" in bright colors out on the streets. Yes, we are pirates, and we're proud of it, too.
 Also, the term is not that negative at all in Sweden, much thanks to the awesome footwork of the Pirate Bureau (Piratbyrån), who have been working since 2003 to educate the public.
 If you are elected, and have the opportunity to become part of the next government of Sweden, do you intend to focus only on the issues in your platform (IP law and privacy)?
 Our current plan is to support the government from the parliament, but not be part of it. If we're part of it, that means we get a vested interest to not overthrow it, which puts us in a weaker position if they start going against our interests.
 Overall, our strategy is to achieve the balance of power, where both the left and right blocks need our votes to achieve a majority, and then support the issues of whichever government that agrees to drive our issues the strongest. Basically, we sell our votes on other issues to the highest bidder in exchange for them driving ours.
 Have you already made any contacts in Swedish politics?
 Contacts... I'm not sure what you mean. Several of us have been shaking hands with some of the established politicians, particularly in the youth leagues, if that's what you mean.
 I was thinking along the lines of exploring possible modes of cooperation with established political parties — are you already taken seriously?
 We are taken seriously by most of the youth leagues and by at least one of the represented parties. In particular, which is what counts, we are now taken seriously by national media. However, we can't tie contacts that explore modes of cooperation quite yet — since our strategy depends on holding the balance of power, we need to not express a preference for whom we'd like to cooperate with, or we'd put ourselves in a weaker bargaining position.
 What is your position on moral rights, as recognized by European Union copyright laws: the right of attribution, the right to have a work published anonymously or pseudonymously, and the right to the integrity of the work. Do you think these rights should be preserved?
 We safeguard the right to attribution very strongly. After all, what we are fighting for is the intent of copyright as it is described in the US constitution: the promotion of culture. Many artists are using recognition as their primary driving force to create culture.
 Publishing anonymously or pseudonymously happens every day on the Internet, so no big deal there either.
 The right to integrity, however, is an interesting issue. We state that we are for free sampling, meaning you can take a sound that I made for my tune and use it in your own tunes, or for that matter, a whole phrase. That's partially in line with today's copyright law on derivative works; as long as you add your own creative touch to a work, you get your own protection for the derivation. We want to strengthen that right.
 You might want to consider the alternative. In the 50s and 60s, a lot of rock and roll bands started doing covers of old classical music. This would almost certainly have been considered to violate the integrity of the original artist — and was considered to do so by many — but in the eyes of many others, it was instead great new culture of a previously unseen form and shape.
 So I don't have a definite answer on the integrity issue. While I am leaning towards the promotion of new culture taking precedence over a limitation right, there may be unconsidered cases.
 Do you feel that trademark law is adequate as it is?
 Yes. We have not seen any hidden costs to trademarks that outweigh the benefits of reducing transaction costs on a market where seller and buyer are not personally acquainted.
 How do you intend to deal with EU treaties which define certain legal frameworks for the protection of intellectual works?
 What can they do? Fine us? Send us an angry letter?
 Come on, countries need to think more like corporations. If the fine is less than the cost to society, which it is in this case, then the right thing to do is to accept the fine with a polite ""thank you"".
 Actually, national media just called me about this very question; the Department of Justice has stated that we can't allow file sharing, as it would break international treaties. My response was that it is more important to not have 1.2 million Swedes criminalized, than it is to avoid paying a penalty fee.
 Do you think that weaker intellectual property laws would lessen the amount of products released in Sweden by foreign companies, such as Hollywood studios?
 As long as they believe that they will have a revenue here that exceeds the cost of operations, they will keep coming here. Anything else would be wrong from a corporate standpoint.
 Besides, you need to remember what we are doing is to change the map according to what reality looks like. We do not want to change people's behavior. We want to change the law so it reflects what the world actually looks like.
 So, as they apparently make a profit today, I expect that to continue.
 Do you feel that the music industry in its current form will still be needed in a world where non-commercial copying is permitted?
 It's not so much if they are needed where non-commercial copying is permitted, rather if they are needed when they're not necessary any more to be the middle man between consumer and artist.
 The music industry will lose its current chokepoint, because they don't add any value to the end product any longer. They will probably survive as a service bureau for artists, but they will not be able to control distribution.
 It's actually quite simple: if they get their act together and provide a service that people want to buy, they will remain. If not, they will vanish. Today, they have legislated that people must buy their service regardless of whether it adds value or not, and that's not gonna hold in the long term.
 Why fight against intellectual property laws, instead of focusing your energy on creating freely licensed content, such as Creative Commons films or open source software?
 I want to raise the issue a level, to show that it's not about payment models or what level of control the copyright holder chooses to exert over his or her work.
 Let me put it this way: we have achieved the technical possibility of sending copyrighted works in digital, private communications. I can send a piece of music in e-mail to you, I can drop a video clip in a chat room. That technology is not going away, leaving us with two choices.
 So — if copyright is to be enforced — if you are to tax, prohibit, fee, fine, or otherwise hinder the transmission of copyrighted works in private communications, the only way to achieve that is to have all private communications constantly monitored. It's really that large.
 Also, this is partly nothing new. We've been able to do this since the advent of the Xerox copier — you could photocopy a poem or a painting and put it in a letter in the mail. Again, the only way to discover or stop that would have been for the authorities to open all letters and check their content.
 So we're at a crossroads here. Either we, as a society, decide that copyright is the greater value to society, and take active steps to give up private communications as a concept. Either that, or we decide that the ability to communicate in private, without constant monitoring by authorities, has the greater value — in which case copyright will have to give way.
 My choice is clear.
 The Pirate Bay was shut down and re-opened days later on a Dutch server. According to a Swedish newspaper report, traffic has doubled since then. How long do you think the cat and mouse game will continue?
 Until one of two things happen: The authorities realize they can't enforce laws that require monitoring all private communications, especially given the large international level of grassroots support, or [they] actually start monitoring all private communications.

"," Sweden's centre-right opposition has narrowly won Sunday's general election, beating a Social Democratic government for only the third time since the Second World War. The provisional results give 48.1% of the vote to the four-party Alliance for Sweden and 46.2% to the government and its two supporting parties, which translates to a seven-seat majority in the 349-seat Riksdag, Sweden's parliament. A detailed summary of results can be found in the Wikipedia article on the election.
 Around 22.50 CET last night Moderate Party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt claimed victory at his party's election night vigil in Stockholm. Referring to the Moderates' renewal under his leadership, he said: ""We stood for election as the New Moderates. We have won as the New Moderates. We will also - together with our Alliance friends - govern as the New Moderates."" Prime Minister Göran Persson admitted defeat shortly afterwards at the Social Democratic Party's election night vigil: ""We have lost the election, but we are not a beaten party. We will fight back."" He said however, that he ""would not lead the comeback"", and announced his resignation as Prime Minister but also that he would resign as party leader in March 2007, at the party conference convened to choose his successor. Mr Persson has announced that he will hand in his resignation at 16.00 CET today.
 The Speaker of the Riksdag, who in Sweden is constitutionally responsible for proposing a new government to the Riksdag, is expected to officially ask Mr Reinfeldt to form a government tomorrow. The opposition Alliance for Sweden (composed of the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal People's Party and the Christian Democrats) had already agreed a common programme and on Mr Reinfeldt as its prime ministerial candidate before the election.
 The centre-right opposition has bounced back from a decisive defeat in the general election of 2002, when the Moderate Party's proposal of large tax cuts and disunity between the four parties led to the government increasing its majority. Commentators are agreed that the move of the Moderate Party towards the centre under its new leader Fredrik Reinfeldt and the agreements reached between the four parties of the centre-right on major policy areas were important in gaining victory. The Moderate Party in particular did well, achieving its best result since 1928 and making a gain of 10.9 percentage points, the biggest gain made by any party since 1914. In contrast, the Social Democrats had their worst result since 1914, with 35.2% of the vote.
 The key issue in the election was employment. The opposition argued that more needed to be done to get people into work to support Sweden's generous welfare state, and proposed to cut income taxes on those with lower incomes and to cut payroll tax, especially for the private services sector and for companies hiring long-term unemployed. This was to be funded mainly by cutting unemployment benefit from 80% of previous income to 70% after 200 days and 65% after a further 300 days. The opposition also argued for more choice in the welfare system.
 The government pointed to Sweden's impressive economic growth, good fiscal situation and low unemployment rate of around 6%. They also attacked the opposition for wanting to undermine the ""Swedish model"" and attacking those who were already most vulnerable by cutting unemployment benefit. The opposition countered by arguing that unemployment is higher than official statistics suggest because of the large numbers of people on long-term sick leave and in early retirement, as well as government employment schemes.
 Sweden's new government will be presented to the Riksdag on 6 October, and will present its first budget on 16 October.

The proposition was passed in a 143 to 138 vote, with one abstention. It was passed with an addendum to be reviewed this fall. The amendment will further stipulate the rights of the Swedish people under the new law.
 The stated intent of the monitoring is to protect against foreign threats, cyber warfare, and the like. The hundreds who rallied to protest the privacy infringement seemed to have their own ideas.

"," Turkey has recalled its ambassador to Sweden after the Swedish Parliament voted to describe Turkey's killings of Armenians in World War I as ""genocide"".
 The Swedish vote came despite the Swedish government's opposition to the resolution, as several parliament members crossed party lines in the vote, which passed the resolution by a vote of 131–130, with 88 parliament members absent.  The Swedish government called the vote a ""mistake,"" but added that it will not influence their position on the matter.
 The Turkish government released a statement saying, ""our people and our government reject this decision based upon major errors and without foundation,"" and Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan immediately cancelled a planned visit to Sweden. Despite the reaction, Turkey said that the moves did ""not correspond to the close friendship of our two nations,"" and they were only recalling their ambassador for consultations.
 The resolution is particularly sensitive given that Sweden has long been a strong supporter of Turkey and their bid to join the European Union, and Turkey has been for years maintaining that their actions in World War I against Armenians did not amount to genocide. Despite Turkey's claims, Armenians have been heavily campaigning for the killings, which they say number up to 1.5 million, to be recognized as genocide, and over twenty countries worldwide have done so.
 Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt said that the vote would likely have a significant effect on the fate of negotiations between Turkey and Armenia, which have been attempting to resume normal diplomatic relations. The Turkish ambassador that was recalled said that the vote would have ""drastic effects"" on the negotiations, and it would have an impact for some time.
 The Swedish vote came not long after a similar vote by a US Congressional panel, which also approved a resolution with similar terminology, leading to the removal of Turkey's ambassador.  In that case, the US government has been trying to prevent the resolution from going further, in an attempt to limit the consequences of the vote.

If he is elected, Lugovoi will be immune from prosecution. This is worrying for the British government, who want to arrest Lugovoi.
 Lugovoi is to be a candidate for the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. The LDPR currently has 35 of the 446 in the Duma, the lower house in the Russian parliament. The leader of the LDPR, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said, ""I head the list (for the December 2 parliamentary elections), the fraction's leader will be third...

 Lugovoi is wanted by the British, as he is the main suspect in the Litvinenko case. A critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Litvinenko had taken refuge in Britain and was murdered after he was fed the radioactive substance polonium-210. Lugovoi, a former KGB agent, met Litvinenko on November 1, 2006. The British want Lugovoi extradited but the Russians refuse, denying Lugovoi has had anything to do with murdering Litvinenko.

"," Russian jets stationed reportedly in the Syrian city of Latakia have been carrying out air strikes since yesterday, in support of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, having notified the United States an hour before.
 Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the strikes against Islamist militants who ""if they succeed in Syria [...] will come to Russia, too"", and clarified he would not be sending ground troops to participate in the Syrian Civil War. He called on Assad to engage in dialogue with ""healthy"" opposition groups.
 The ITAR-Tass news agency reported earlier yesterday Putin had been given the green light for the air raids by the upper chamber of Russia's legislature. The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said Russia responded after Assad had sent a letter seeking assistance from Putin. SANA also reported the strikes were carried out in conjunction with the Syrian Air Force and had focussed on ISIS facilities in a number of locations.
 The US State Department said US aircraft would continue to operate throughout the region. An agreement to hold military talks was announced by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry. Lavrov said it was necessary to ""establish channels of communications to avoid any unintended incidents"". However, US officials questioned the purpose of the Russian strikes, stating the targeted areas were unlikely to be under ISIS control.

Chaos broke out in the Ukrainian parliament as several smoke bombs were thrown during a debate about the extended lease on a Russian naval base in Ukraine. Members of parliament (MPs) were seen fighting on the chamber floor while opposition MPs threw eggs at the speaker of the house, Volodymyr Lytvyn.
 It is not clear who threw the smoke bombs, although opposition MPs were thought to be responsible, but the debate continued despite the lingering smoke and chaos. The speaker had to be protected by two aides holding umbrellas and politicians held handkerchiefs to their mouths. 
 Along with the brawling MPs, thousands of people waited outside the parliament building protesting the extended lease. 
 The clashes began as members of parliament were debating extending the lease on the Sevastopol naval base. The Russians currently have a lease on the base until 2017. The Russians have offered Ukraine cheaper supplies of Russian natural gas in exchange for a further 25 years on the lease. 
 After the chaos had calmed down, MPs voted on the agreement and the deal extending the lease was backed 236 to 214. The deal was then put forward in the Russian lower house of parliament, where all 410 Russian MPs voted in favour of the deal.

"," British Prime Minister Tony Blair bowed to pressure from within his own Labour Party today by publicly confirming he will resign within a year. ""I would have preferred to do this in my own way,"" said Blair who added ""the next party conference in the next couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader."" However, he refused to name the specific date of his resignation, ""The precise timetable has to be left to me and has to be done in the proper way,"" Blair insisted. ""I'm not going to set a precise date now. I don't think that's right. I will do that at a future date, and I will do that in the interests of the country.""
 He apologised for the party's conduct this week saying it ""has not been our finest hour, to be frank"". 
 Demands that Blair announce his resignation plans have mounted over the past few months particularly over concerns about the Prime Minister's strong support for Israel during the Israel-Hezbollah war, the perception that he is a loyal follower of United States President George W. Bush and a precipitous slide in Labor's support in public opinion polls where the party is now at a 16 year low. 
 Yesterday, eight Labour MPs resigned from their junior government positions over Blair's refusal to announce his retirement. They had previously been considered staunch Blairites. The British press reports of a shouting match yesterday between Blair and his likeliest successor, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown over the handover date. 
 ""I want to make it absolutely clear today that when I met the prime minister yesterday, I said to him, as I have said on many occasions to him and I repeat today, that it is for him to make the decision,"" Brown said. 
 ""I said also to him, and I make clear again today, that I will support him in the decisions he makes, that this cannot and should not be about private arrangements but what is in the best interests of our party and, most of all, the best interests of our country.""
 Despite Blair's announcement, several MPs expressed their dissatisfaction at his refusal to name a precise date and demanded that he leave sooner rather than later. 
 Manchester Blakeley MP Graham Stringer told the BBC if Blair ""thought it was going to take the politics out of the next nine months that simply is not going to happen"". 
 MP Doug Henderson said ""It doesn't seem to me that the public knows any more about the PM's retirement plans. People keep saying to me that the Labour party must have a clear direction forward with clear priorities and a new leader before the May 2007 (regional) elections."" 
 The eight MPs who resigned as junior ministers or parliamentary secretaries, Wednesday, expressed a concern in their resignation letter that Blair needed to go soon in order not to harm the party's prospects in next May's elections to the Scottish parliament, Welsh assembly and English local authorities.
 Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 when Labour defeated the Conservative government of John Major. He has led the party to three majority victories and promised before the last election that his third term would be his last.

"," Demands that the British Prime Minister Tony Blair set a date for his departure as leader of the British Labour Party reached a new level today as seven government members resigned to protest his continued leadership. 
 Junior Minister Tom Watson and six Parliamentary Private Secretaries had previously been considered loyal Blair supporters. Wayne David, Ian Lucas, Mark Tami and David Wright, the resigning PPSs, signed a letter stating their concern that the ongoing leadership crisis would hurt Labour at next year's elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and English Local Authorities. Two others, David Mole and Khalid Mahmood have also resigned as PPSs. Parliamentary Private Secretaries are Members of Parliament appointed to assist Cabinet ministers. Blair responded by calling Watson ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong.""
 Watson told BBC News he no longer believes it is in the best interests of the country for Blair to continue as prime minister. 
 The resignations come in spite of a report in The Sun newspaper quoting unnamed friends of the prime minister saying he would resign as Labour leader on May 31, 2007. The report has not been confirmed by Blair or his office. 
 Earlier this week at least 14 MPs who were first elected in 2001 and were  previously thought loyal to Blair, including Watson and the 6 PPSs, signed a confidential letter to Blair calling on him to publicly announce a date for his resignation. The letter was leaked to the press. 
 Conservative Leader of the Opposition David Cameron responded to the resignations by saying the government was ""divided and in meltdown"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said that the national interest was ""not being served by the continuing uncertainty over Mr Blair"" and that the prime minister ""should either resign or set a date.""

"," Annabel Goldie, Scottish Conservative Party leader from 2005 to 2011, has announced she will stand down as an MSP at the next elections in 2016. Goldie, who has been an MSP for the West Scotland (previously West of Scotland) electoral region since the Scottish Parliament's formation in 1999, said she intends to focus on her role in the House of Lords, where she has been a peer since 2013.
File:Annabel Goldie.jpg
 
In a statement today, Goldie said leading the party was an ""enormous honour"" for her. She also said: ""It has afforded me both satisfaction and pleasure to serve my constituents and to serve the parliament and I will look back with great happiness at my time as an MSP. I am grateful to friends and colleagues from all parties for their support. Sometimes we found common ground, sometimes we disagreed but never I hope with rancour nor disrespect. Politics is a rough trade but we have built a strong parliament in Scotland of which we can all be rightly proud."" She said because of Ruth Davidson, her successor as Scottish Conservative leader, the party is now ""in fine fettle and stands a great chance of making real progress in the years ahead,"" concluding by saying: ""I look forward to continuing to work as part of that effort in the House of Lords in the years to come.""
 Davidson responded to the news by calling Goldie an ""unstoppable force"", adding: ""She has been an inspiration to a whole generation of Scottish Conservatives, and she has been a tremendous mentor, support and friend to me. In Holyrood, she has fostered both affection and respect from all members – regardless of their political affiliation – and her retirement from the Scottish Parliament will leave an Annabel-sized hole which won't ever quite be filled. She is unique."" Meanwhile, David Cameron, UK Conservative leader and UK Prime Minister, said: ""Annabel is one of those rare breeds in Scottish politics, somebody known by her first name alone. When she was Scottish Conservative leader, I valued her sage advice. She has been a towering strength to our party in Scotland, a doughty debater in the TV studios and Scottish Parliament and has one of the sharpest wits around. I wish her a long and happy retirement after 17 years unstinting service at Holyrood – but look forward to seeing her on the red benches of the Lords for years to come."" 
 Goldie, the Scottish Conservatives' first ever female leader, was elected unopposed. She took up the role in the aftermath of David McLetchie's resignation from the role in an expenses usage controversy and subsequent resignation of Brian Monteith from his Conservative whip role in the Scottish Parliament for briefing the media against him. Meanwhile, as Scottish Conservatives won 18 seats in the Scottish Parliament in 1999 and 2003, the party had been less successful in UK general elections in Scotland; Conservatives went up from zero out of a possible 72 UK MPs in Scotland in 1997 to one in 2001. This led to Goldie remarking in her inaugural speech in 2005 that: ""The wheels are back on the wagon - and I'm the nag hitched up to tow it."" She also said: ""The party is still way ahead of where it was in 1997. And my first task is to take it forward to 2007."" However, under Goldie's leadership, the number of seats the Scottish Conservatives won in the Scottish Parliament slightly decreased from 18 in 2003 to 17 in 2007 and to 15 in 2011. At the same time, the number of Conservative MPs stood at one out of a possible 59 after the 2010 UK general election.
 In the aforementioned 2005 speech, she also said the party could be trusted with devolution in Scotland, adding: ""making devolution work better means real devolution: not the lumbering and cripplingly expensive array of government departments, government advisers, consultants, quangos, quasi-quangos and agencies with all their expensive appendages, but devolving down to people and their communities, their right to make their own decisions about their lives, how for example they procure healthcare and how they educate their children."" Goldie would go on to sit on the advisory board for the Smith Commission, which was set up to examine which further political powers should be devolved to Scotland following the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. More recently, Goldie supported a reduction in the voting age for Scottish Parliament elections from 18 to 16 in a vote earlier this month, commenting: ""I think it is an opportunity for them to continue their high level of engagement in topical affairs that we saw with the independence referendum.""
 Goldie, a member of the Salvation Army's West of Scotland Advisory Board and a Church of Scotland elder, is not the only Scottish Conservative MSP intending to stand down in 2016. Mary Scanlon, Gavin Brown, Alex Fergusson and Nanette Milne all reportedly intend to leave the Scottish Parliament next year.

"," A Fatal Accident Inquiry (FAI) ruled on Thursday a helicopter crash into the North Sea might have been prevented had proper maintenance procedures been followed. All sixteen on board died when the aircraft went down off the Scottish coast.
 After a hearing in Aberdeen, Sheriff Principal Derek Pyle found Bond Offshore Helicopters failed to remove a component after a metal shard was found. The shard suggested spalling, or the shedding of metal particles in the aircraft's gearbox. ""The size and shape of the particle found [...] were consistent with an advanced stage of classic spalling"" according to the inquiry's findings.
 A week before the crash Bond mulled partially replacing the gearbox. The aircraft went down after the gearbox failed in flight. Pyle found a failure in communication between Bond and helicopter manufacturer Eurocopter had led to the decision not to replace the gearbox.
 The routine flight was taking oil workers back to Aberdeen from the Miller offshore oil platform, owned by BP. The aircraft radioed air traffic control to inform they were twenty minutes from Aberdeen Airport but six seconds later was confronted with an oil warning light and grinding sounds. The crew declared an emergency but the main rotor broke free, which in turn smashed through the tail leaving the aircraft to plunge into the sea. The aircraft crashed within twenty seconds of the first sign of trouble.
 The inquiry is surrounded by controversy owing to the five-year gap between accident and findings, and the decision by Crown Office not to prosecute over the crash. ""For a criminal prosecution to have taken place, the Crown would have to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt"" a Crown Office statement said on Thursday. ""The Sheriff Principal makes clear that a reasonable doubt remained over the technical cause of the crash"".
 Although the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) and Sheriff Pyle found a catastrophic gearbox failure triggered the crash, the exact cause of the failure was never conclusively decided. After hearing expert evidence Pyle found the balance of probabilities  pointed to spalling, but could not rule out a manufacturing defect. 
 The inquiry's findings note ""that it would be an extraordinary coincidence if the failure properly to carry out inspection and maintenance of the helicopter’s gearbox was not causative of a catastrophic failure of the same within a matter of days. But, as the evidence made clear, such a coincidence was indeed a possibility."" Pyle's report added ""the small piece of the helicopter which would have proved the matter beyond any doubt [has] not been recovered from the seabed"".
 Bond have released a statement noting ""We have always accepted that we made mistakes through honest confusion over telephone calls and emails."" Sheriff Pyle found Bond's employees ""tried to carry out their jobs as diligently as they could. All of them impressed me as engineers who well understood the vital importance of their role in ensuring [...] safety"". He also found staff were well-trained and resourced, echoing findings by the AAIB and the Civil Aviation Authority.
 Pyle noted Bond readily accepted they should have properly followed the maintenance manual and normally did, but ""on one occasion, that fundamental rule was broken"" and the crash was likely a result. Bond, Eurocopter, and investigators all gave evidence.
 Trade unions and victims' families, however, have slammed the decision not to prosecute. While welcoming the FAI's conclusions, victims' lawyer Tom Marshall said the families wanted to review the decision not to prosecute with the Lord Advocate, and are also seeking a broader public inquiry. Audrey Wood, whose son Stuart died in the disaster, said ""How [Crown Office] arrived at that decision [not prosecuting] will haunt us, as not only did we hear of multiple breaches of health and safety, but the decision was also made without all the evidence being present, as vital witness statements had not been given"". 
 Wood said there were multiple breaches of health and safety law that could be prosecuted.  Crown Office's statement counters ""evidence presented during the FAI has not altered the insufficiency of evidence, therefore the decision not to hold criminal proceedings remains the correct one"". Unite union branded their decision a ""travesty of justice"".
 Politicians have criticised the five-year delay holding the FAI, as has Scottish Trades Union Congress general secretary Grahame Smith who said ""It is vitally important that lessons are learned at the earliest opportunity following tragedies where lives are lost"". Sheriff Pyle himself concluded ""what can, I think, very properly be said is that nearly five years [delay] is on any view far too long and that we all have a responsibility for that. [...] everyone concerned in future fatal accidents involving aircraft of whatever kind should do much better.""
 Labour have called for new FAI rules; MSP Patricia Ferguson has put a bill before parliament;  the Scottish Government says Sheriff Pyle's conclusions are being scrutinised. MSP Richard Baker said the victims' families and North Sea oil workers, who routinely use helicopters, had waited ""far too long"" for the FAI to conclude. ""FAIs should never be delayed so long again.""
 Crown Office expressed sympathy with the families involved for the delay but blamed the complex nature of the investigation, and pointed out the AAIB, Civil Aviation Authority, and local police had all already conducted their own enquiries. The AAIB spent 30 months investigating.
 Twelve victims were from Scotland, many of those from in and around Aberdeen where the six-week inquiry was held. Three more were from elsewhere in the UK and the last was a Latvian national. Half of the fourteen passengers and two crew died ""instantaneously"" and the rest died very shortly after impact with the sea from blunt force trauma, the inquiry found. 
 None survived long enough to drown, according to Sheriff Pyle. Nonetheless he noted ""there was a poignant moment when a witness was being taken through the graph in the AAIB report which set out the timeline of the accident that I, if not others present, understood for the first time the true horror of what took place.""
 Audrey Wood said ""The length of wait for nearly five years has been intolerable for all the families and we, the families, feel let down by the system."" Bond's statement this week says ""We would like to express again our deep sorrow at the 16 lives lost. Bond Offshore hopes [the inquiry] brings a degree of closure to the families, friends and dependents of those who died in the tragedy of 2009."" The sheriff also noted the ""courage"" of victims' families, who attended the full hearing.

"," Jim Murphy yesterday announced he intends to stand down as Scottish Labour Party leader next month, after narrowly surviving a no confidence vote. Murphy said he will present a list of suggested reforms to be made to the party, including changing the system for electing party leader to one member, one vote, upon offering his resignation at the next meeting of its national executive in June. Murphy also said he will not stand for the Scottish Parliament election in May 2016 and will ""do something else"".  At a meeting in the Scottish city Glasgow yesterday, the party's national executive held a vote of no confidence in Murphy; he won by 17 votes to 14. ""Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago"", Murphy said. Murphy became Scottish Labour leader in December 2014, following Johann Lamont's resignation from the role. Until Scottish Labour holds a fresh leadership election — its sixth in a span of eight years — Kezia Dugdale, currently the party's deputy leader, is to assume the role of acting leader for the time being. Murphy cited concerns about Scottish Labour being divided as a contributory factor to his decision. ""Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party"", he said yesterday. ""We have been the greatest force for change in our nation’s remarkable history. The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else’s leadership and I am confident about my party’s future.""
 The announcement came nine days after the party lost all but one of its 41 Scottish seats, including Murphy's East Renfrewshire constituency, to the Scottish National Party (SNP) in a UK general election, and eight days after Ed Miliband said he would stand down as leader of the UK Labour Party.
 There was controversy regarding whether Murphy should retain his role following this performance. Labour Party supporters were reportedly asked to sign a letter supporting Murphy's leadership, to be presented at the executive meeting yesterday. Calls for Murphy to resign came from multiple quarters, including trade unions Unite and ASLEF, as well as Labour MSPs Alex Rowley and Elaine Smith. Earlier in the week, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said ""the anti-Scottish card that was played by Lynton Crosby and the Conservatives"" had caused them to win a majority in the general election, before going on to say: ""I lay the blame for that very squarely at the feet of Scottish Labour. Not only have they lost Scotland but I think they've been responsible for making certain that the Conservatives were back in power in Westminster."" However, trade unions USDAW and Community were amongst those supporting Murphy's continued leadership. 
 In a speech, Murphy suggested he did he did not want the party to be divided as a result of his leadership. ""It is clear that the small minority who didn’t accept my election as party leader by the majority five months ago also won’t accept the vote of the Executive today and will continue to divide the party if I remain"", he said. Murphy singled out McCluskey for criticism, claiming to have ""been at the centre of a campaign by the London leadership of the Unite union in blaming myself and the Scottish Labour party for the defeat of the UK Labour party in the general election. That is a grotesque insult to the Scottish Labour party."" He went on to criticise what he called McCluskey's ""destructive behaviour"", commenting that: ""Whether in Scotland, or in the contest to come across the UK, we cannot have our leaders selected or deselected by the grudges and grievances of one prominent man. The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn’t serve at the grace of Len McCluskey and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.""
 Reacting to the news, SNP leader and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in."" Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Willie Rennie said: ""Credit to [Murphy]. He stepped up and energetically campaigned for his beliefs. I wish him the best for the future."" Harriet Harman, the acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said Murphy had been a ""hugely important figure"" for them, adding: ""Jim has given so much to the Labour Party over the last twenty years. He, I know reluctantly, took the responsibility for leading Scottish Labour at the most difficult election they have ever faced. He did so with incredible energy, purpose and dignity [...] He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.""
 Scottish Green Party co-convenor Patrick Harvie was more critical in his response, arguing the Greens should be the opposition of the Scottish Parliament instead. Harvie said Murphy's resignation was ""almost inevitable, but even as he announced it he promised to further weaken Labour’s relationship with the wider labour movement. People haven’t left Labour because of the trade unions, but because the party itself long ago strayed from its principles. Without a clear sense of purpose, it has seemed to care only about holding office instead of creating new ideas for a better society. It’s clear that the Scottish Parliament needs an opposition that’s creative and challenging, but which can act constructively too.""
 Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson tweeted: ""Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.""
 Wikinews asked Unite the Union to comment on the story and has yet to receive a response. However, Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scotland leader, earlier stated: ""Jim has done the decent thing. Scottish Labour needs to recover, re-engage and reform. It can now begin that process.""

"," The wife and children of Abdel Baset Ali al-Megrahi, a Libyan man convicted of the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, were amongst other relatives and friends of prisoners protesting against alleged miscarriages of justice in Edinburgh yesterday. The airliner came down over Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988, killing 270 people.
 Megrahi is due an appeal against his conviction next year. Also present at the unprecedented ""Silent Walk For Justice"" was the family of Jason MacIntyre, a champion cyclist killed when Robert McTaggart ran him down in a van in January, for which he received a six month driving ban after conviction of careless driving. MacIntyre's wife said McTaggert should have instead been charged with causing death by dangerous driving.
 Also present was the mother of Luke Mitchell, a 48-year-old convicted in 2005 of the murder of teenager Jodi Jones, his then girlfriend. She carried a poster saying ""miscarriages of justice have no voice"" and says fresh evidence has surfaced that warrants a new appeal and a new legal team has been appointed to represent him.
 The march was organised by Swede Annie Börjesson's mother and her best friend Maria Jansson, who between them campaigned for a fatal accident inquiry after Annie's body was found washed ashore at Prestwick in December 2005. Ms Jansson said the march was an event for people who felt let down by the legal system and not about individual cases, saying ""We are not here to judge each other or measure each other – we are here because we are humans.""
 Despite this, around 30 people surrounded Megrahi's wife Aisha and their four sons Khalid, Mohamed, Ali and Moutasim to support them, holding posters with Megrahi on them. The marchers travelled down the Royal Mile to the Scottish Parliament Building, then held a candlelit vigil.
 Outside the building, Mr al-Megrahi's lawyer Tony Kelly read a statement on behalf of Aisha. ""My children and I are here today to give support to my husband, Abdelbaset, who is a victim of a miscarriage of justice and terminally ill, and also to give support to all those other victims of miscarriages of justice,"" it said. ""We are here for the sake of all these innocent souls who are suffering in silence. I would like to thank all those who continue to support him, pray for him and express sympathy with him.""
 She also asked for the 'compassionate' people of Scotland to ""consider the suffering of my husband"", saying of him: ""He is an innocent and very ill man who is suffering every day from the psychological and physical stress. Let us pray for justice and the accomplishment of the truth.""

"," The Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports Scottish independence from the UK, has pulled off a historic, albeit narrow, victory in yesterday's Scottish elections.
 In the third Scottish election since the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, the left of centre SNP beat the ruling Labour Party by a single seat. It won 47 seats, while Labour won 46, down from the current 50.
 It is the first time since the parliament opened that Labour has been beaten, and the first time in fifty years that they have not had a majority of Scottish constituency seats in any election.
 SNP leader Alex Salmond declared: ""Scotland has changed for good and forever."" He added that the Labour Party had ""lost the moral authority to govern Scotland.""
 The current First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell of Labour said: ""While I recognise that the SNP are the largest party by the narrowest of margins, Alex Salmond must himself recognise that he does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament or anywhere near a majority of the vote.""
 It is believed that many factors caused the Labour vote to slump and the SNP vote to rise, including the war in Iraq and the renewal of Trident, which are both unpopular in Scotland.
 The election also raises a serious dilemma for the Labour party's Gordon Brown, a Scotsman widely tipped to succeed Tony Blair as the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. Brown is vehement in his support of the Union, and is a Westminster (London parliament) MP for Kirkcaldy. An SNP government in Scotland will find itself facing the very Labour party it beat in power in London. 
 Turnout was up 2% on the last Scottish election.
 The election was highly controversial, not least for having three separate systems, running in tandem -
 The three systems, along with difficulties with electronic counting meant that maybe as many as one hundred thousand ballot papers were ""spoiled"". In addition, there was also huge problems with the postal vote.
 Due to the extensive computer problems, votes had to be cancelled early on Friday morning, and postponed to later in the day.
 Many other problems beset the election, with a helicopter from the Western Isles constituency being held up by fog, and a boat carrying ballot papers from the Isle of Arran, breaking down in the Firth of Clyde.
 In addition to the SNP and Labour, the other parties results' were as follows -
 The Scottish Socialist Party, Solidarity and the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party were all wiped out.
 In order to establish a majority in the Scottish Parliament, the SNP must form a coalition with one or more of these parties. The Liberal Democrats, who were in coalition with the Labour party in the first two terms of the Scottish parliament, are a possibility.
 Other parties that campaigned for seats in Holyrood included the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), the British National Party (BNP), the Scottish Unionist Party, the Scottish Socialist Labour Party, the Christian Peoples Alliance and the Scottish Christian Party.
 The Scottish National Party, while not gaining the landslide it had wished for, made breakthroughs in Glasgow (Govan), Edinburgh (Edinburgh East) and also took both seats in Dundee.
 The Liberal Democrats gained seats in Dunfermline West, but their losses mean the number of seats they hold is unchanged.
 While the Scottish election was going on, the Welsh were also having their election for the Welsh Assembly. Plaid Cymru gained a seat from Labour at Llanelli. The Conservatives had their best showing since the Assembly began.
 The final results show that the membership for the new assembly will be:- 
 Labour             26  -4
Plaid Cymru        15  +3
Conservatives      12  +1
Liberal Democrats  6   -
Independent        1   -
 In England, the elections were more minor, dealing only with local authorities. However they can be an important indicator of how battleground seats might go in the General Election, expected in 2-3 years time.  The Conservatives made the greatest gains, but did not make the breakthrough in Northern England that they would have hoped. The Liberal Democrats did not make the advances that they had hoped, and stayed at more or less the same level. Elsewhere, Cornish regionalists Mebyon Kernow gained an extra seat bringing their total to seven, and the Eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and Liberal Party (not to be confused with the Liberal Democrats) gained seats in several areas of England.

"," The Scottish Parliament has narrowly rejected the Scottish government's proposed £33 billion budget.
 The devolved parliament was tied 64-64 on the motion to approve the budget after two Green Party MSPs switched away from backing the minority Scottish National Party (SNP) administration. The Presiding Officer (speaker) of the parliament, Alex Fergusson, used his casting vote to reject the budget. Finance Secretary John Swinney of the SNP announced that he would immediately reintroduce it. The budget had the backing of the Scottish Conservatives.
 Green MSPs had sought a £100 million, 10-year home insulation scheme, whilst the Scottish government had offered a smaller pilot scheme. This offer was increased as the vote approached but failed to convince the Greens to back the budget.
 If a new budget is not in place by the start of the financial year in April, the current budget will rollover. However, Scottish ministers say this will cause a £1.8 billion cut in spending. 
 Scotland's GDP fell by 0.8% in the last quarter.

"," Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond made his first official visit outside Scotland as First Minister, meeting his counterpart in Northern Ireland, First Minister Ian Paisley.
 The leader of the Scottish National Party, who is calling for Scotland and Northern Ireland to present a united approach toward governance, addressed the Northern Ireland Assembly and said Stormont, and the Scottish Parliament ""now share a political model based on necessary compromise.""
 ""The Deputy First Minister hasn't stopped being a nationalist and you, First Minister, haven't stopped being a unionist,"" Salmond said, referring to Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness of Sinn Féin and Paisley, of the Democratic Unionist Party. ""Nevertheless, what matters is identifying the areas where you agree and working on those. It doesn't remove the other issues, but it allows a democratic chamber to function and an executive to govern. 
 ""No-one in this chamber should feel that their aspirations, their view of the future, is anything other than legitimate,"" Salmond said in his speech, quoted by BBC News Online.
 Salmond hailed the dedication of Prime Minister Tony Blair and the resolution of the Northern Ireland political crises.
 ""You will know how closely many in Scotland follow events and I am acutely aware of the difficulties you faced and, indeed, still face in the path to progress,"" he said in the Stormont Senate chamber.
 ""In that context, the efforts to make strides forward in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland are truly remarkable.
 ""Scottish Government and the people of Scotland salute you for that collective leadership.
 ""Leadership is a concept that is often cheapened and devalued in modern politics but the members of this Assembly have done something truly impressive.
 ""Over the last years, you have turned a seemingly intractable situation into one full of hope and optimism. That is real leadership.""
 Salmond, as a Scottish Nationalist, said he is a passionate believer in Scottish independence, but compromise is still needed. 
 Salmond said that he thinks the Edinburgh Parliament and the Belfast Assembly present a united front on devolution issues as they seek more home rule powers.
 Among the issues would be lowering corporation tax to a 12.5 percent rate.
 “It is not a question of ganging up, it is a question of formulating ideas in a constructive way,” Salmond said. “And on many of these issues it will also be, in my opinion, in the interests of the Westminster Government.""
 He said the British-Irish Council, meeting next month in Belfast, is ""the best mechanism we currently have for Scotland and Northern Ireland to work together within the devolved structure"".  
 Salmond is also planning to visit Welsh leader Rhodri Morgan in addition to visits to Ireland, Brussels and Norway.

"," Members of the Scottish Parliament voted 98–15 in a free vote yesterday to approve the Marriage and Civil Partnerships (Scotland) Bill, which seeks to legalise marriage between partners of the same sex. If the legislation is passed, Scotland may start allowing same-sex couples to marry in 2015.
 Scottish government ministers have attempted to reassure religious groups who oppose same-sex marriage they will not be required by law to conduct them, but may ""opt in"" to conduct ceremonies for same-sex partners. The law also contains provisions that would protect individuals from being required to perform marriages if their congregation has opted-in but they disagree with same-sex marriage.
 Alex Neil, the Scottish government health secretary, said the bill ""will create a more tolerant society in Scotland and will mean that, in respect of marriage, there is genuinely equal rights right across the entire community"".
 Support for the bill crossed party lines. Jim Hume from the Liberal Democrats said the vote was ""a demonstration that our Scottish society values everyone — no matter their sexuality"".
 Conservative MSP (Member of Scottish Parliament) Ruth Davidson — who is herself a lesbian — argued in Parliament that the bill ""matters to the future nature of our country. We have an opportunity today to tell our nation's children that, no matter where they live and no matter who they love, there is nothing that they cannot do. We will wipe away the last legal barrier that says that they are something less than their peers. We can help them to walk taller into the playground tomorrow and to face their accuser down knowing that the Parliament of their country has stood up for them and said that they are every bit as good as every one of their classmates.""
 From the Labour party, Mary Fee argued against the claim that existing civil partnership legislation was satisfactory: ""I ask the opponents of the bill who comment that civil partnerships were introduced for LGBT people whether the suffragettes were happy when the Representation of the People Act 1918 was introduced, allowing women over 30 to vote. No, they were not. They fought for a further decade to enfranchise all women and equalise the voting ages of men and women.""
 Elaine Smith, also a Labour MSP, said she feared MSPs opposing same-sex marriage were being ""bounced"" into supporting the bill for fear of being branded homophobic. ""Since indicating that I did not intend to support the redefinition of marriage, my religion's been disparaged, I've been branded homophobic and bigoted, I've been likened to the Ku Klux Klan and it was suggested that I be burnt at the stake as a witch"", Smith claimed.
 John Mason from the Scottish National Party said ""Parliament is not reflecting public opinion on this issue"" and the public was more divided on the issue than the parliamentarians in Holyrood were.
 Outside the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday, a demonstration was held by the LGBT rights group Equality Network supporting the bill. Tom French from the Equality Network said of the vote: ""Tonight the Scottish Parliament voted by an overwhelming majority to back same-sex marriage and uphold the principle that we should all be equal under the law.""
 Colin Macfarlane from the gay rights group Stonewall Scotland also welcomed the vote: ""This is a truly historic step forward. We're absolutely delighted that MSPs have demonstrated overwhelmingly that they're in touch with the twenty-first century.""
 The Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Scotland both oppose the Bill. Reverend Dr William Hamilton from the Church of Scotland said while the Church opposes same-sex marriage, they stand against homophobia and ""will continue to be a constructive voice in the national debate"" about the bill.
 In July, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill passed into law in Westminster and will allow same-sex couples to marry in England and Wales.

The Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill allows for religious bodies to opt in to providing same-sex wedding ceremonies. The Bill was opposed by religious bodies including the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church.
 During the Parliamentary debate a number of amendments were advanced and rejected, including an amendment to recognise that ""a belief in marriage as a voluntary union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others for life is a belief worthy of respect in a democratic society"". The bill allows humanist celebrations in addition to civil and religious ceremonies.
 Alex Neil, the Scottish cabinet minister responsible for the legislation, said: ""This is a historic moment for equality in Scotland. I am proud that the Scottish Parliament has taken this progressive and hugely important decision in favour of equal rights in our country. It is right that same sex couples should be able to freely express their love and commitment to each other through getting married. Marriage is about love, and that has always been at the heart of this issue.""

"," David McLetchie, a former leader of the Scottish Conservatives, died today in a hospice in Edinburgh whilst suffering cancer. He was 61.
 In 1997, a general election produced no Conservative Members of Parliament from within Scotland for the UK's joint parliament in London. McLetchie took over the Scottish Conservatives the following year and in 1999 eighteen Conservatives were elected to the newly-formed devolved Scottish Parliament.
 UK Prime Minister David Cameron said today ""when devolution came, [McLetchie] picked up the reins and made sure that the Scottish Conservatives had a strong voice"". Cameron also called McLetchie ""one of Scottish politics' most formidable intellects and finest debaters. All he did was carried out with dedication and conviction, and his passing leaves a gap in the lives of all who knew him."" The Prime Minister said he is ""deeply saddened"" by the news.
 McLetchie lead the party in Scotland for seven years before quitting in 2005 amidst a row regarding expenses claims. He continued to serve as an MSP for the Lothian area until his death. Born in Edinburgh in 1952, he remained there for his school and university education and became a solicitor specialising in inheritance tax before turning to politics, first running for office in 1979.
 Current Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson said ""First and foremost my deepest condolences go to his wife Sheila and their family. David had so much left to give and it is difficult to describe just what his loss at such a relatively young age means to all who knew him."" She said he ""had friends in every political party and he was often the fulcrum of some of the most unusual alliances in order to improve, force or block a piece of legislation.""
 Outside of the Conservative party, Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont spoke of McLetchie's ""passion, drive and determination"", noting his ongoing parliamentary work despite ill health. She called his death ""a huge loss to the Scottish Parliament"". Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie spoke of a ""towering figure in this new Scottish parliamentary age... who made a difference"" and ""commanded immediate respect and trust from friend and foe alike.""
 Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond called the late politician ""an extremely effective leader of the Conservative group in the first Parliament, allowing it to punch politically well above its actual numbers"".
 McLetchie played golf and followed football and rugby, supporting Hearts. He has a son from a previous marriage, two stepchildren, and four grandchildren. He put his switch from law to politics down to ""a combination of a mid-life career change and a mid-life crisis...  I wanted the challenge of representing the Conservative Party in a parliament which was an ambition I had harboured since my teens, but which I had not been able to put into effect in the preceding 20 years because of career and family commitments.""

 Head of the UK's National Housing Federation David Orr commented: ""It's bad policy, it's bad economics, it's bad for hundreds of thousands of ordinary people whose lives will be made difficult for no benefit — and I think it's about to become profoundly bad politics.""

In the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, two councillors from the Scottish National Party (SNP) began a petition Friday, the day after Comhairle nan Eilean Siar — the local government council for the Western Isles — said it would discontinue flight services between the islands of Benbecula and Barra as part of its 2013 / 2014 budget.  The petition — entitled ""To petition the Scottish Parliament that Comhairle nan Eilean Siar maintains its support for the lifeline air services between Stornoway, Benbecula and Barra"" — has also been launched in response to another council decision to restrict flight services between the islands of Benbecula and Lewis to three days a week, although the move has been temporarily suspended for two weeks to allow for NHS Western Isles to provide funding for said services. Otherwise, the changes come into effect late next month. Gordon Murray and Rae MacKenzie, the two councillors who launched the petition, are both from the town of Stornoway in the isle of Lewis. At the council's meeting, Councillor MacKenzie suggested an alternative budget retaining flight service financing. The petition says the council's decisions ""risk the future of all internal flights within the Outer Hebrides and would severely undermine the transport connections which have been built up between the islands over the last forty years, with serious implications for the local economy and community.""
 The council's decision to remove the £148,000 (about US$230,000 or €172,000) subsidy means Benbecula – Barra flights are to cease operation within the next few weeks. When the decision comes into effect, travelling between the islands will only be available through the use of ferry services. The council, which was trying to achieve about £5 million (US$7.75 million or €5.8 million) in spending reductions, said some 75% of seats on these flights were vacant.
 Angus MacNeil, MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar in the British Government, and Alasdair Allan, MSP for the same constituency in the Scottish Government, both of whom are SNP members, have criticised the council's decision. MacNeil said he was ""disappointed"" about the move and claimed Comhairle nan Eilean Siar was ""axing these services while pocketing the cash"" provided to them by the Scottish Government. Meanwhile, Allan said the council's action was ""a significant blow to the community"". He said, from Benbecula: ""As someone who used the Barra to Benbecula flight today, it is clear to me what importance this service has in keeping the Western Isles connected.""
 Council leader Angus Campbell subsequently criticised MacNeil for his remarks, saying he was ""extremely disappointed"" by them. ""The use of the term 'pocketing the money' shows a disrespect for the democratic process of local Government"", he said. He also requested that MacNeil and Allan ""stand shoulder to shoulder with the Comhairle to campaign for increased funding for the Western Isles to help deal with these issues rather than turning on their democratically elected local council over individual issues they don’t particularly like.""
 Campbell described the council's 2013 / 2014 budget as ""the most difficult we have faced during my time as a councillor.""

"," The United Kingdom electorate took to the polls yesterday to vote in both local elections and a UK-wide referendum regarding the system used to elect its members of parliament to the House of Commons. The polls opened at 07:00 BST (0600 UTC) yesterday morning and closed at 22:00 BST (2100 UTC) last night.
 Alongside the normal local elections for seats on 279 councils, and elections for seats in the devolved Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Irish Assemblies, the country saw the first nation-wide referendum since 1975, regarding potentially replacing the current first past the post voting system with the Alternative Vote (AV) system currently used for general elections in Australia, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea, as well as for some mayoral and party leadership elections worldwide, including in the UK.
 Mayoral elections also took place in Leicester, Mansfield, Beford, Middlesbrough, and Torbay. Some areas also experienced elections to parish councils, while the constituency of Leicester South underwent a by-election after its Labour MP Sir Peter Soulsby stood down to run for mayor.
 One polling station in Stockport was delivered the wrong ballot papers, causing around 90 people to cast invalid votes. Those affected were, where possible, contacted and asked to cast their vote again, according to the local council. Another, in Llandeilo, was closed for two hours after escaped dogs bit four people nearby.
 The AV referendum came about as a result of the coalition agreement between the Liberal Democrats, who support voting reform and promised a referendum in their campaign, and the Conservatives, who initially opposed reform but agreed to a referendum as a compromise, following the election in May last year.
 The Scottish National Party (SNP) hopes to retain control of the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, where it currently runs the minority government, in the hopes of potentially holding a referendum regarding Scottish independence, which they did not deliver in their first term in power; meanwhile Labour hope to end their coalition with Plaid Cymru by taking control of the Welsh Assembly; however, sources from within the party report that it is likely that Labour will fail to reach a majority. Little is expected to change in Ireland, where the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin are expected to retain their dominance over the Northern Irish Assembly.
 Polls taken prior to the election implied that AV would be rejected by some margin, but due to low turnout — despite good weather — the results are likely to be unpredictable. The results of the AV referendum are not due to be declared until 20:00 BST (1900 UTC) today, and counting is not due to begin until 16:00 BST (1500 UTC).
 As usual, Sunderland was the first council to report, and was held by Labour; as is the case with many councils in the north of England, it is considered a Labour safe seat. Early predictions indicate that a number of Liberal Democrat councilors in northern cities will lose their seats to Labour or Conservative candidates. Former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett reportedly said that  the national opinion had changed from ""Clegg mania"" into ""Clegg pneumonia"". In an interview with the BBC, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg put predicted Liberal Democrat losses down to voters being ""angry"" at the coalition government, but also said that the electorate is ""not stupid"", and would vote in council elections based on local—rather than national—factors.
 The first Scottish Parliament constituency to report was Rutherglen, which is held by the incumbent Labour MP, James Kelly. Despite being considered Labour's fourth safest Scottish seat, it experienced a swing of more than seven percent towards the SNP, and large Labour losses are predicted across Scotland. Nearby East Kilbride was the second to report, and was gained by SNP candidate Linda Fabiani from the Labour incumbent Andy Kerr.

"," Newly-appointed UK Prime Minister David Cameron today travelled north to Scotland to meet with the country's First Minister, Alex Salmond, for the first time since the general election. According to The Scotsman, around 200 noisy protesters greeted the new PM, forcing security staff to take him into the devolved parliament via a back door.
 Cameron's Conservative Party have traditionally been unpopular in Scotland. They won just one out of 59 Scottish seats in the election, gaining around seventeen per cent of the vote. Prior to the meeting, Salmond told reporters he intended to press Cameron for greater Scottish financial independence from Westminster, including greater tax powers— something supported by the Liberal Democrats, the Conservatives' new coalition partners, and Danny Alexander the Lib Dem Scottish Secretary and on which Cameron has promised a cross-party commission. 
 Cameron had been seeking what he called a ""fresh start"" to restore ties between the parliaments at Westminster and Hollyrood. In addition to meeting the first minister, Cameron also met with the sixteen Conservatives currently sitting in the devolved Scottish Parliament. 
 After the meeting, both Salmond and Cameron agreed that the conversation had been ""positive and constructive"" and Cameron pledged a mutual ""respect agenda"" which would see him address the devolved Scottish parliament every year if invited and, in return, MSPs would appear before Commons committees in Westminster.  
 Cameron outlined part of his spending plans in preparation for an emergency budget, scheduled for fifty days after the election. He announced that no cuts would be made to the £30 billion annual budget for Scotland though that £6 billion in spending cuts would have to be made— something likely to cause controversy in Cameron's coalition government. However, both Cameron and Salmond anticipate that cuts may need to be made in subsequent years.
 At a conference, Salmond said the talks had been ""positive, constructive, detailed and substantive. I prefer a 'respect agenda' to a 'disrespect agenda'."" He added that ""[h]ow we judge the outcome of that agenda will be based on the policy options the Westminster government pursues, not just the words"". At the same conference, Cameron told reporters ""I believe, and Danny [Alexander] believes, that we should be pursuing the Calman agenda, and that that is a much greater degree of fiscal autonomy for Scotland.""

 Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been accused of ""indecency and violating religious values"" for   embracing and kissing the hand of an elderly woman - his former schoolteacher - to express his gratitude. 
 The Iranian Hezbollah newspaper issued a statement saying, ""The Muslim Iranian people have no recollection of such acts contrary to Shariah law during Islamic rule."" The Iranian government instituted Shariah law soon after the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
 Ahmadinejad has been criticised in the past for his objections to the enforcement of hijab and for permitting women to attend soccer matches.

 Ségolène Royal (Socialist Party) and Nicolas Sarkozy (UMP) made their final appeals to voters today.
 Campaigning is not allowed tomorrow or on the day of voting, which will take place on Sunday, May 6.
 Royal, who has been falling behind in the polls, said, ""It is my responsibility today to alert people to the risk of [his] candidature with regards to the violence and brutality that would be unleashed in the country [if he won],"" specifically referring to the type of violence seen in the 2005 civil unrest.
 Sarkozy responded in a radio interview with Europe 1: ""She's not in a good mood this morning. It must be the opinion polls... She's finishing in violence, in a certain state of feverishness. When I hear her remarks, I wonder why a woman of her qualities carries such violent feelings. It adds nothing to the debate.""

 Following yesterday's parliamentary election, the Scottish National Party (SNP), led by Alex Salmond, became the largest party in the new Scottish Parliament. The SNP is committed to hold a referendum on Scottish independence by 2010.
 After a confusing day, in an election marred by many thousands of rejected ballot papers, the party has a 1 seat advantage over the Scottish Labour Party (SLP) who have controlled the Executive for the last 8 years.
 For Salmond to become take the position of First Minister from SLP's Jack McConnell he needs to gain the support of another party. Only the Scottish Conservative Party and the Scottish Liberal Democrats (the current junior partner of the SLP) are large enough.
 The parliament election was held on a combined 'first past the post' and Party List system, at the same time as local council elections, (which do not have the same constituencies) and used, for the first time, a Single Transferable Vote system. This appears to have confused many voters and led to a high number of spoilt papers.

"," The ruling party in Turkey has asked the Grand National Assembly of Turkey to approve a general election to take place June 24, 2007. The next general election was scheduled for November.
 The Justice and Development Party (AKP), which holds 363 of 550 seats in parliament, apparently feels that it will not be able to achieve quorum in the vote on its presidential candidate Abdullah Gül.  Analysts reportedly project that AKP would fare well in the elections.
 Just yesterday, the Constitutional Court annulled the first round of voting in the presidential election.
 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan called the court's decision ""a bullet aimed at democracy... It has made it almost impossible for the parliament to elect a president in the future."" He also called for the constitution to be changed so that the president is elected by popular vote, instead of the current method where parliament elects the president. Erdoğan also proposed to change the constitution to allow the president to serve 2 terms of 5 years instead of the current single term of 7 years.
 The Turkish pro-secular movement first feared that prime minister Erdoğan would run for president. When the ruling AKP chose Abdullah Gül as their candidate instead, they feared that Gül might have a hidden Islamic agenda and be a threat to the separation between religion and state in Turkey. But AKP denies such agenda, and Gül has promised to adhere to secularist principles if he would become president. Gül's wife has in the past fiercely defended her right to wear the Islamic headscarf.
 Meanwhile, the United States has joined the European Union in asking the Turkish Armed Forces to stay out of the process.  The military sees itself as the guardian of secular government in Turkey and has toppled the government four times since 1960. 
 Two pro-secular rallies with several hundred thousand demonstrators took place in April, one in Ankara and the other in Istanbul. National symbols were strongly present during these protests, and people were chanting ""Turkey is secular and will remain secular"" and ""We don't want an imam as president!"".

"," The Justice and Development Party (AKP) in Turkey secured a solid mandate in Turkish general election, held yesterday. Although Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan could celebrate getting 46.5% of the vote, more than 12% better than the last poll in 2002, his party will have to settle for slightly fewer seats in Turkey's parliament, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. AKP will now have 340 seats versus 353 formerly.
 Before a cheering crowd, Erdoğan said yesterday: ""We've passed an important test of democracy that is an example to the world. The people have pronounced the Justice and Development Party as the central political power in Turkey.""
 AKP called this election, ahead of schedule, after opposition parties boycotted the vote on AKP's presidential candidate, Abdullah Gül, and the Constitutional Court annulled the result. Speaking about the issue of the presidency, Erdoğan told a news conference: ""We will resolve this matter without causing tensions.""
 United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Miliband, said: ""It's very important that across Europe we reach out to the new government in Turkey when it is formed. A stable and secure Turkey is massively in our interests.""
 In Washington, spokesperson Tony Snow said: ""It was a free and fair election, and Turkey remains an important ally of the U.S.""
 EU Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn said the government must move forward on reforms as EU entry talks have stalled. ""We expect the new government will be formed swiftly. It is essential that the new government will re-launch the legal and economic reforms with full determination and concrete results,"" he told reporters.
 The Nationalist Movement Party (MHP), saw the greatest growth in support. Although in 2002, they pulled nearly 6% in support it was not enough for any seats. The 14.3% achieved in this election, got the MHP 71 seats. The general secretary of the party said it won't seek to create tensions.
 The Republican People's Party (CHP) was dealt the biggest setback in the election. CHP saw an erosion in support that cost them 66 seats, leaving them with 112. 
 ""The only danger at the moment is failure to reach an accord over the presidency,"" said election observer and columnist for Hürriyet, Erdal Saglam.

"," On Monday, the Prime Minister of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan paid an official state visit to the United States. During his visit, he met with President George W. Bush in the White House for talks that centered on the Turkey-PKK conflict and the Iraq War.
 Turkey is concerned about attacks by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) that originate from within the borders of Iraq. There have been cross-border clashes between Turkey and the PKK. Turkey has threatened a major incursion, something the US seeks to avoid, as it could upset the relative calm in northern Iraq. The PKK has been listed as a terrorist organization by a number of countries and organizations. The PKK's goal has been to create an independent socialist Kurdish state in a territory which it claims as Kurdistan, an area that comprises parts of south-eastern Turkey, north-eastern Iraq, north-eastern Syria and north-western Iran.
 After the meeting, Bush said of the PKK that ""they are an enemy of Turkey, they are an enemy of Iraq, and they are an enemy of the United States."" He pledged additional intelligence to help Turkey, an offer that was also made by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice last week, during her Middle East tour.
 Bush further offered mutual military assistance with both Turkey and Iraq to fight the PKK. ""We want to work in a close way to deal with this problem,"" he said.
 Erdogan mentioned during the post-meeting news conference that the Grand National Assembly of Turkey has already authorized military action in Iraq. He did not, however, say whether such action would be imminent.
 Neither leader indicated to what level, if any, that direct military cooperation would exist.
 Ali Babacan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Turkey, was last week not so impressed by Rice's offers. ""We are at the point where words have been exhausted and where there is need for action,"" he said on Friday.
 ""The Bush administration would like to just kick this can down the road,"" said Bulent Aliriza, a political observer for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The problem is, the can has been kicked down the road to the point where now it can't be kicked anymore.""

 Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that although the motion does not indicate that a military operation is imminent, it is necessary for Turkey to be able to respond to bomb attacks which have been blamed on Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels in Iraq.

Whichever party has a majority of MPs after all constituencies have announced their results has the opportunity to form a government.
 The incumbent party before the dissolution of parliament was Gordon Brown's Labour Party, exit polls suggested a small Conservative Party majority, which—when this swing is projected nationally—would cause a hung parliament. The exit polls also suggested that despite reports that support for the Liberal Democrats had surged following the first national televised leaders' debates in the United Kingdom, the Liberal Democrats would suffer from a third party squeeze.
 On the morning of Friday 7, 2010 the accuracy of the exit polls was demonstrated when it was revealed that there was indeed a hung Parliament and that although the Conservative Party had the greatest number of seats and votes it would be impossible for them to achieve an outright majority. The constitution of the United Kingdom allows for the incumbent Labour Party to first attempt to form a government and incumbent Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that he would allow civil servants from the Cabinet Office to help facilitate negotiations. Despite the Labour Party openly courting the Liberal Party, their leader Nick Clegg has stated that as the party with the most seats and most votes the Conservatives have the right to attempt to form a government.

 Police have arrested Lord Levy, chief fundraiser to the  Labour Party and close associate of Tony Blair.  Lord Levy was arrested by the Specialist Crime Directorate of London’s Metropolitan police as part of an on-going investigation into the cash-for-peerages row which has troubled the Labour government since the start of the year. He was bailed on Wednesday afternoon without charge pending further enquiries.
 In a statement, Lord Levy said the arrest was “totally unnecessary”. A spokesman also said: ""He has not been charged and does not expect to be, as he has committed no offence."" 
 The cash-for-peerages affair erupted earlier this year, after an independent body reported that Tony Blair had sold peerages (the title of Lord) to businessmen in exchange for secret donations to the Labour Party. This potentially breaks the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act of 1925 which was originally introduced after Prime Minister Lloyd George was caught selling peerages for personal funds. 
 The ruling Labour Party admitted soon after that it had borrowed over £14 million before the last general election in 2005. The opposition Conservative Party also admitted it had been loaned £16 million by wealthy businessmen. It’s believed that as chief fundraiser, Lord Levy arranged the Labour Party’s loans. 
 All political parties deny any wrong-doing, although the arrest of one of the Prime Minister’s closest allies is going to provide yet more scandal for the already troubled party. 
 Downing Street has so far declined to comment on what they call a “party matter” and Levy himself has accused the police of “over-reacting”. Some politicians have commented  that the situation could be very serious for Mr. Blair.

A compromise put forward by the Conservatives that would have allowed easier passage through the Commons of the proposed new anti-terror legislation has been rejected by Prime Minister Tony Blair.  The bill proposes new ""control orders"" for terror suspects which include house arrest, curfews, tagging and bans on internet and phone use. The bill will replace current powers that allow the detention of foreign terror suspects without trial which has been ruled against as a breach of human rights by the law lords.
"," The Conservatives wanted a ""sunset clause"" inserted into the bill which would have allowed ministers to revisit it in November. MPs from all parties have severely criticised the way the bill has been seemingly ""steamrollered"" through the Commons with only two days to debate the plans before a vote is called.
 Conservative leader Michael Howard said in the Commons that it would be ""far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through.""
 Mr. Blair said that the new house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable. ""I believe they are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk,"" he added.
 Opposition to the bill by the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have already won concessions this week. Home Secretary Charles Clarke has backed down and allowed judges to have the first say in the most severe control order cases, however, this may not be enough to ensure a smooth ride through the Lords. It is expected that the bill will face tough opposition and demands for a radical re-draft.
 Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has urged the Conservatives to ""stick firm? There's a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months,"" he said.
 A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch said that it was a ""basic principle"" that people should only be punished after a fair trial. ""Having a judge impose those punishments does not sanitise them either,"" she added.

"," An investigation by the Sunday Times newspaper has made allegations of bribery against four members of the House of Lords, Britain's unelected upper legislative body.
 The paper says it has secretly made recordings of Lord Truscott admitting to making a recent energy bill more favourable to a client who markets ""smart"" electricity meters.
 The Sunday Times also alleges that Lord Taylor of Blackburn had claimed to have made changes to a bill to help Experian, a credit reference agency. The paper adds that Lords Moonie and Snape had agreed to take payments from undercover journalists.
 The Daily Telegraph reports that Baroness Royall of Blaisdon, the Leader of the House of Lords, issued a statement saying ""I am deeply concerned about these allegations. I have spoken to the members who are the subject of them and I shall be pursuing these matters with the utmost vigour"".
 The AFP news agency notes that the Lords' Code of Conduct requires that members ""must never accept any financial inducement as an incentive or reward for exercising parliamentary influence"". The Sunday Times says that there have been ""persistent rumours"" that lobbyists have switched to concentrating on the Lords rather than the Commons because ""MPs are under greater scrutiny"".

"," On Thursday, the United Kingdom's (UK) Conservative Party netted an additional 66 seats, totaling 365 seats, surpassing the 326 seats needed for a majority in Parliament.  Results and reaction came in early on Friday.  Before this election, the Conservative Party was the largest party, but had just 318 seats, which is not a majority.
 Conservative Party leader and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""humbled"" by the results and ""...I and we will never take your support for granted. And I will make it my mission to work night and day, flat out, to prove you right in voting for me this time and to earn your support in the future."" Election implications regarding the UK's efforts on leaving the European Union (EU) were described by Johnson as a ""historic mandate"", saying he intends to leave the EU by the end of January.
 The conservative party gained 66 seats since Parliament was last in session, while the second largest party, Labour, lost 42. The Scottish National Party (SNP) gained 13 seats and Liberal Democrats lost 10. There were no Change UK candidates elected, which lost all 5 of its seats. The Brexit Party failed to obtain any seats.
 The Labour Party's leader, Jeremy Corbyn announced he will not seek the party's leadership position in the next general election cycle. Liberal Democrats are to find a new leader after Jo Swinson was defeated in Dunbartonshire East by an SNP candidate with a 149 vote margin. The Blyth Valley seat has, since its creation in 1950, always elected a Labour Member of Parliament, but elected a conservative candidate in this election.
 Voter turnout was down by about 1.5% of the electorate from the 2017 election cycle, with this time about 67.3%.

The former Cabinet minister stood for election as leader of the Labour Party, losing out to his brother, Ed Miliband.
 In a letter to Alan Donnelly, chair of the South Shields Constituency Labour Party, David Miliband lists the reasons for his stepping back from the limelight of British politics: ""After the leadership election, I felt I could be most helpful to the party on the front line, in South Shields and around the country, rather than on the front bench in Parliament. I felt this gave Ed the space and at the same time the support he needed to lead the party without distraction.""
 David Miliband expanded the reasons in an interview with the BBC, saying it had been hard ""to accept that I can best help the Labour Party by not just giving the space between the front bench and the back bench to Ed, but the space between the front bench and 3,000 miles away"".
 Ed Miliband praised his brother, saying British politics would be ""a poorer place"" without David: ""Having spoken to him a lot over the past few months, I know how long and hard he thought about this before deciding to take up the offer. I also know how enthusiastic he is about the potential this job provides.""

"," Britain has stated that it will reconsider the asylum application of a gay Iranian teenager who believes he will be persecuted for his sexuality if he is deported back to Iran. The announcement Friday by the British government came after the European Parliament urged a resolution to the case and said that Iran has a history of torturing and executing homosexuals.
 Britain had initially rejected an asylum request by 19-year-old Mehdi Kazemi, and Kazemi fled to the Netherlands, where his case was turned down and he returned to Britain. British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith released a statement on the case: ""Following representations made on behalf of Mehdi Kazemi, and in the light of new circumstances since the original decision was made, I have decided that Mr. Kazemi's case should be reconsidered on his return to the UK from the Netherlands."" 
 Eighty members of Britain's upper house of Parliament sent a letter to Jacqui Smith, appealing to the government to ""show compassion and allow Mr. Kazemi to have a safe haven in the United Kingdom."" Roger Roberts of the House of Lords initiated the petition, and stated: ""There is no doubt that he will be persecuted and possibly face state-sanctioned murder if he is forced to return."" Simon Hughes, Member of Parliament for North Southwark and Bermondsey, said he would support Kazemi if he returns to the United Kingdom: ""I hope Mr Kazemi will now come back to Britain where arrangements are already in place for an urgent meeting with him, his family, specialist lawyers and myself to prepare a new application to the Home Office.""
 Gay rights advocate and spokesman for the British gay rights group OutRage!, David Allison commented ""It's cruel to even suggest sending him back ... The history of gays in Iran has been horrific."" Ben Summerskill of the British gay rights organization, Stonewall, said: ""We are obviously delighted that the home secretary has listened to the representations that were made in this case ... There are overwhelming reasons why people should not be deported to Iran in the current circumstances, and it is important that Britain is seen as a safe haven.""
 Borg Palm, Kazemi's solicitor, stated Kazemi was pleased with the news but would have an unstable future in Britain without asylum: ""He is very much afraid of being allowed to stay in Britain but without being granted official permission. That would then put him in a no man’s land. He would be very unhappy in the long term.""
 Kazemi came to Britain in 2005 to study English. His uncle spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity, and said that his nephew was studying in Britain in 2006 when his partner in Iran was arrested and hanged after being charged with sodomy. Kazemi's uncle told CNN: ""Under torture and pressure, (the partner) revealed Mehdi's name as his boyfriend."" Gay sex is considered a crime in Iran, and is punishable by death. Kazemi told British authorities in his asylum application that Iranian police were after him, and that he could face execution if he returned to Iran. Kazemi stated in his asylum request: ""I cannot stop my attraction to men ... If I return to Iran I will be arrested and executed like [my boyfriend]. Since this incident ... I have been so scared.""
 After Britain's Home Office initially denied Kazemi's asylum application, he fled to Canada and then the Netherlands, where he was detained. Kazemi faces deportation from the Netherlands to Britain, after their highest court rejected his plea on Tuesday. The Netherlands' highest court rejected the case, citing EU law that Kazemi's case was the responsibility of the country where he first requested asylum.
 A resolution passed by the European Parliament Thursday asked EU states ""to find a common solution to ensure that Mehdi Kazemi is granted asylum or protection on EU soil and not sent back to Iran."" The resolution also stated that Iranian authorities ""routinely detain, torture and execute persons, notably homosexuals"" and that ""Mehdi's partner has already been executed, while his father has threatened him with death.""  
 In a September 2007 speech at Columbia University, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was challenged by University president Lee Bollinger for Iran's treatment of gays.  Ahmadinejad stated that ""In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country,"" drawing laughter from the audience. ""In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it."" According to Iranian human rights activists, over 4,000 gay men and lesbians have been executed since the Iranian Revolution of 1979.

"," Yesterday, the United Kingdom's House of Lords passed the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill at Third Reading, the last major step in changing the law to allow marriages between same-sex partners in England and Wales. The bill is to become law this week and same-sex marriage ceremonies are likely to start in 2014.
 During the brief debate in the Lords, Peers supporting the law wore pink carnations. Lord Alli, who is openly gay, said because of passing the law ""my life and many others will be better today than it was yesterday"". The Lords discussed an amendment to review how to deal with survivor pension benefits due to the same-sex partners of those in civil partnerships. Other amendments the Lords have discussed include a review on whether to allow humanists to conduct weddings, and a review on whether to allow opposite-sex partners to enter into civil partnerships.
 A handful of opponents of the Bill spoke during the debate including Lord Cormack, who said: ""Those who support the Bill have won; there is no doubt about that. It would be churlish and ridiculous to pretend otherwise and I, for one, would never do so."" Lord Framlingham criticised ""the Government's complete rejection of any meaningful amendments"" and said the Bill ""is built entirely on pretence. It pretends that there is no difference between a man and a woman. From this deceit have sprung all the problems we have been wrestling with — problems we have failed to resolve and which will bedevil generations to come.""
 In summing up the debate, Baroness Stowell said: ""I believe that we have brought forward a Bill that is a force for good and that the change it brings about is right and reflects the change in society. However, there is no question whatever that anybody who disagrees with it should in any way feel that their views have not been properly taken into account during our debates.""
 A group of supporters of the Bill held a celebration outside Parliament yesterday during the debate and carrying on into the evening. A small number of opponents of the Bill turned up to protest. The celebrations included musical performances by the London Gay Big Band and the London Gay Men's Chorus, and Ben & Jerry's provided free ice cream and cake.
 A planned demonstration by Christian Concern was cancelled to ""conserve energy"" as ""there will not be a vote at the third reading of the same sex marriage bill on Monday and what happens on that day in the House of Lords will be a mere formality"".

"," Lord Falconer, the former Lord Chancellor of the United Kingdom, announced on Tuesday that he would present a bill next week to the House of Lords to make it legal for patients suffering with terminal illnesses to request assistance from their doctors to end their lives. If passed, the law would apply to those with less than six months to live and mirrors a similar system in Oregon.
 Falconer had previously chaired the Commission on Assisted Dying, an independent inquiry supported by the think tank Demos, that recommended that those with less than a year to live with a terminal illness ought to be able to request assistance to end their lives. Dignity in Dying, a campaign group for legalisation of assisted dying, is supporting the bill.
 The bill's provisions would apply to those over 18 with a diagnosed terminal illness and access to lethal drugs would require demonstration of mental competence, independent assessment by two doctors, and being informed of other treatment and end-of-life options. The bill would not provide any new legal options for those with permanent but non-terminal illnesses like locked-in syndrome sufferer Tony Nicklinson, who brought a case through the English courts to demand a right to assisted dying. Nor would it help Paul Lamb, a paralysed man in Leeds who is continuing Nicklinson's case.
 Bills introduced by members of Parliament do not usually become law without endorsement from the government. In 2006, David Cameron said of assisted dying: ""I do not think we should tread over this line and we should not allow doctors or others positively to accelerate death — because I think the long-term consequences of permitting such action are too likely to be dangerous for society.""

"," Boris Johnson, the Conservative politician currently serving as Mayor of London, announced yesterday he intends to stand for Parliament in the 2015 General Election.
 Johnson stated he intends to also serve out his term as London mayor which ends in 2016. He did not announce which constituency he plans to seek election in, saying it was up to local Conservative parties to make that decision. Johnson was formerly MP for Henley from 2001 to 2008 before he resigned in order to seek election as London's mayor.
 He also rejected the suggestion he was trying to become the next leader of the Conservative Party, telling the BBC: ""I think it's highly unlikely that that will happen because there's no vacancy. I think David Cameron has been a brilliant prime minister.""
 He later added in another BBC interview: ""When David Cameron finally steps down, in 2030 or whenever, it may be that there's a vacancy, but it will probably be filled by a person who's a teenager now.""
 If elected, Johnson would be breaking a promise he made in 2012 in an interview with London's Evening Standard newspaper: ""I made a solemn vow to Londoners to lead them out of recession, bring down crime and deliver the growth, investment and jobs that this city so desperately needs. Keeping that promise cannot be combined with any other political capacity"".
 Prime Minister David Cameron previously said Johnson was a ""great striker you want on the pitch"". Yesterday, David Cameron's Twitter account followed up on this: ""Great news that Boris plans to stand at next year's general election — I've always said I want my star players on the pitch"".
 Sadiq Khan, Labour's shadow justice secretary, responded to the news by saying ""Boris Johnson's announcement reveals how weak David Cameron is and how out of touch the Tories remain. [...] Today has also shown Londoners that, when they need a mayor prepared to address the big challenges facing their city, Boris Johnson's priority is succeeding David Cameron rather than serving their interests.""
 Conservative MP and former chief whip Andrew Mitchell welcomed Johnson's announcement: ""I think he's a remarkable politician. He reaches parts of the voting public that other people don't reach. He's a part of the Conservative DNA.""

"," Yesterday, the United Kingdom's Queen Elizabeth II announced she will comply with the request of Prime Minister Boris Johnson to suspend Parliament for parts of September and October. Critics from across Britain's political spectrum have claimed this is a move by Johnson to foil opposition to his plans for a no-deal Brexit by October 31.
 Per the request, Parliament would meet briefly in early September and then not reconvene until October 14, two weeks before the current Brexit deadline. According to Johnson, this break will allow him to develop plans for his administration, which he is to present on October 14, the same day the Queen is scheduled to give a speech.
 According to Johnson's critics, this is a ploy to achieve a no-deal Brexit, meaning the UK would cease to be part of the European Union (EU) without any specific arrangements made about trade, tariffs, the European Court of Justice, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, trademarks, and other matters. Currently, the British parliament has a majority against a no-deal Brexit.
 ""We're not going to wait until Oct. 31 before getting on with our plans to take this country forward"", Johnson said in an interview. ""This is a new government with a very exciting agenda"".
 Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn called the move a ""smash and grab on our democracy"".
 House of Commons Speaker John Bercow commented on the matter — which the BBC noted as an unusual move by a Speaker — ""However it is dressed up, it is blindingly obvious that the purpose of [suspending Parliament] now would be to stop [Parliament] debating Brexit and performing its duty in shaping a course for the country.""
 Prime Minister Johnson told the public via Twitter, ""Jeremy Corbyn wants to cancel the referendum and argue about Brexit for years [...] I am committed to leading our country forward and getting Britain out of the EU by October 31st.""
 Member of Parliament (MP) Yvette Cooper of the Labour Party added, ""Boris Johnson is trying to use the Queen to concentrate power in his own hands — this is a deeply dangerous and irresponsible way to govern.""
 Conservative MP Philip Hammond commented, ""It would be a constitutional outrage if Parliament were prevented from holding the government to account at a time of national crisis.""
 In the government of the United Kingdom, the monarch is the head of state but not the head of government. Officially, the monarch is allowed to prorogue a session of Parliament, in which it is suspended but not officially dissolved. During prorogation, the members of parliament may not officially debate or work on laws or policies. According to the House of Commons Library, in the past few decades most prorogations have been for at most two weeks.

"," Legislation to allow same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom has passed the second reading in the House of Commons Tuesday by 400 votes to 175. Amendments to the Bill are now to be discussed and voted in the committee stage and then debated in the House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber.
 The Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill 2013, if passed, would allow same-sex couples to get married in both civil ceremonies and religious ceremonies where a particular denomination has agreed to provide such services. The government have said the Bill contains a ""quadruple lock"", four separate measures to protect the religious freedom of those who do not agree with same-sex marriages on religious grounds.
 The government's proposals have caused ""growing discord"" within the Conservative Party according to a letter written by a group of Conservative local constituency chairmen. The letter, which was delivered to Downing Street on Sunday, claimed the policy would cause ""significant damage to the Conservative Party in the run-up to the 2015 election"" and ""resignations from the party are beginning to multiply"".
 The Conservative MP Sir Peter Bottomley criticised media focus on the letter sent to Downing Street, telling the BBC the importance of the letter was overblown: ""There are, say, 630 associations, there's now two active officers for each one, that's over 1200. Twenty five past and present officers went to Downing St — 25 out of over 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 — doesn't strike me as newsworthy.""
 Bottomley said he believes the majority of people in Britain are supportive of same-sex marriage although older people tend to be against it, and said the legislation is ""not going to be a big deal"".
 On Monday, in response to the letter sent to Downing Street, another letter from fifty grassroots activists within the Conservative Party including constituency chairmen and the chairman of Conservative Future, a group for Conservative supporters aged under 30, argued Conservative MPs should support the Bill: ""Please do not allow the impression that all Conservative Party activists are opposed to gay marriage. Many of us strongly agree with the proposal. Nor is it true that gay marriage has no mandate. David Cameron made his support for it clear in his first conference speech as party leader, and won loud applause. It was in the party's equalities manifesto at the last election.""
 The letter said opposition to same-sex marriage would ""risk alienating the voters we will need in 2015"" and argued the plans have broad support from the wider public.
 In response to criticism from within the Conservative Party, Maria Miller, the government minister responsible for the Bill, wrote an editorial in The Times defending the proposals. Miller wrote: ""The proposals for change are straightforward — if a couple love each other, then the state should not stop them getting married unless there is good reason — and being gay is not reason enough.""
 Miller defended the bill from accusations it would infringe on religious freedom: ""This bill is about choice. It is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so, while protecting the rights of those who don't agree.""
 The Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire, Nadine Dorries, confirmed on Monday in a post for the blog ConservativeHome that she plans to vote against the Bill, saying the Bill fails to make heterosexual and gay couples equal because the Bill does not require gay couples ""to make any commitment to faithfulness whatsoever in the way straight couples are required to"" and because there is no requirement for consummation. She also argued it is politically unwise for the Conservative Party, claiming loss of support ""could lose us as many as 100 seats"". Dorries said Labour's introduction of civil partnerships was ""the right thing"" but the Labour Party would not have supported same-sex marriage because it would cost them support from Catholics. She argued that if Conservatives push for same-sex marriage to become law, Labour would then not have to take a political hit for passing the Bill.
 The Conservative Party activist Tim Montgomerie contradicted claims that the Conservatives would face a drastic drop in support, claiming a YouGov survey shows it won't affect voter intentions: ""the effect might well be negative in the short-term but — AT WORST — it will reduce the Tory vote from about its current 34% to 33%"".
 Conservative blogger and radio host Iain Dale — who is also openly gay — argued on his blog that a number of the opponents in the Tory ranks are themselves in the closet and may face outing attempts by gay rights campaigners. On ITV, Dale said he had looked at a list of MPs who intend to vote against the Bill on the website of Campaign for Equal Marriage: ""I note with interest the names of several MPs who most people in the Westminster Village know to be closet gays. And I note also the names of two supposedly straight MPs who I know to be conducting gay affairs at the moment. I don't believe in 'outing' anyone, but because of the rank hypocrisy there will be others who will take a different view.""
 Before the debate, Labour leader Ed Miliband said he will vote ""proudly"" for equal marriage: ""I don't think that the person you love should determine the rights you have. That's why I'll be voting for equal marriage, along with the rest of the shadow cabinet.""
 Liberal Democrats committed to supporting the policy. A notable exception among the Liberal Democrats is John Pugh MP who said in a letter to his constituents published on Monday he will vote against the Bill because he believes ""it achieves none of its objectives and weakens the link between marriage and the family"".
 In the run up to the debate, MPs claim to have received emails they characterised as ""vitriolic"", ""appalling"", and ""unpleasant"" from both supporters and opponents of the Bill. The Conservative MP Angie Bray said: ""You get emails from one side saying you're morally deficient if you vote no and emails threatening hell fire and brimstone if you vote yes. It has frankly been an ill-tempered debate on both sides.""
 Some MPs have said negative emails from opponents have prompted them to support the Bill. An anonymous MP told The Independent: ""Quite a few of us who were considering abstaining will vote in favour of gay marriage because of the unreasonable nature of the emails we have been receiving. Some of the emails I've had are simply appalling and I'm fed up with it.""
 Conservative MP David Burrowes, who opposes the Bill, said unpleasant messages have also come from supporters of the Bill: ""I've had death threats, hostility and hate mail. My children have even been told that their dad is a homophobe.""
 Burrowes made his case against the Bill Tuesday on ConservativeHome: ""Marriage has never been just about the happiness and fulfilment of the individuals involved. It is part of a bigger picture — human societies need stable family groupings, especially for the nurture and care of children. The man-woman union at the heart of marriage has to do with this bigger picture.""
 Burrowes also argues the marriage Bill will not significantly advance gay rights, pointing instead to his support for an introduction of a new offence of homophobic hatred.
 Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin wrote an article defending the legislation for ConservativeHome, arguing ""the Bill respects those who feel that same-sex marriage does represent an attack on their view of marriage"" and since ""nobody is going to be forced to take part in a same-sex marriage who does not wish to do so, I very much hope that in turn they will respect those who feel that the present inequality of marriage is an attack their identity and freedom as individuals.""
 The newly elected Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, used his first post-appointment public statement to reaffirm the Church of England's opposition to the Bill: ""I stand, as I have always stood over the last few months, with the statement I made at the announcement of my appointment, which is that I support the Church of England's position on this. We have made many statements about this and I stick with that.""
 The Guardian opinion writer Polly Toynbee argued the fallout within the Conservative Party has failed to show they are ""a modernised party"" but instead revealed them ""as a nest of bigots"", warning that the party disunity threatens the Conservatives' chances at the next election.
 The Second Reading started just after 12:30pm on Tuesday. Maria Miller introduced the bill: ""The depth of feeling, love and commitment between same-sex couples is no different from that depth of feeling between opposite-sex couples. The Bill enables society to recognise that commitment in the same way, too, through marriage. Parliament should value people equally in the law, and enabling same-sex couples to marry removes the current differentiation and distinction.""
 Miller argued against the charge that the Bill redefines marriage by pointing to previous reforms of marriage law: ""Suggestions that the Bill changes something that has remained unchanged for centuries simply do not recognise the road that marriage has travelled as an institution.""
 Miller concluded her introduction of the Bill by appealing to fairness: ""Despite all the discussion and debate, this Bill is about one thing — fairness. It is about giving those who want to get married the opportunity to do so, while protecting the rights of those who do not agree with same-sex marriage. Marriage is one of the most important institutions we have; it binds families and society together, and it is a building block that promotes stability. This Bill supports and cultivates marriage, and I commend it to the House.""
 The Labour politician Yvette Cooper gave the Opposition response. She welcomed the Bill and argued: ""Parliament should not stop people getting married just because they have fallen in love with someone of the same sex, and we should not say that same-sex relationships are intrinsically worth less.""
 Regarding the claim that the Bill would eventually force religious groups to perform same-sex ceremonies, Yvette Cooper stated: ""It is clear that they will not have to.""
 Cooper also argued against a number of objections to the Bill. She said some object that marriage is by definition between a man and a woman, but: ""We cannot hide discrimination simply by calling it a definition. Marriage has changed many times over the centuries — and thank goodness for that.""
 In response to the argument that marriage is for the purposes of procreation and protection of children, Cooper argued: ""Many marriages are childless, and we do not prevent people who are too old or too sick to have children from getting married. We do not do fertility tests at the altar.""
 Following the speeches of Miller and Cooper, MPs from all parties spoke both for and against the Bill. Opponents argued their opposition to the bill was not driven by homophobia or bigotry, the Labour MP Robert Flello stating: ""the debate has been characterised as bigoted religion on the one hand versus equality on the other.""
 Conservative MP Edward Leigh argued marriage exists for children: ""Marriage exists to keep the parents exclusively committed to each other, because, on average, that is the best and most stable environment for children. If marriage were solely about the relationship between two people, we would not bother to enshrine it in law, and nor would every culture, society and religion for thousands of years have invested it with so much importance.""
 Leigh then suggested proponents were motivated by their own interests rather than the interests of children: ""Marriage is not about 'me, me, me', nor about legally validating 'my rights' and 'my relationships'; it is about a secure environment for creating and raising children, based on lifelong commitment and exclusivity"".
 The Conservative MP Nick Herbert introduced some levity into the debate when he ridiculed the idea that heterosexuals would be threatened by gay and lesbian couples getting married: ""Darling, our marriage is over: Sir Elton John has just got engaged to David Furnish"".
 David Lammy MP compared the campaign for gay rights to civil rights: ""Separate but equal is a fraud. It's the language that tried to push Rosa Parks to the back of the bus.""
 During the debate, a number of gay MPs spoke in support of the bill. Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams noted: ""Through my teenage years being openly gay was virtually impossible as it was terrifying in terms of the abuse.""
 Another Conservative MP, Crispin Blunt, spoke of the importance of the bill to him as a gay man: ""Semantics matter. Words express the values of society. This bill about marriage is part of the astonishing and wonderful change that has taken place over the last fifty years that has taken millions of us from criminalisation to legal equality and the enjoyment of self-worth and validation. That certainly wasn't apparent to me as a young man. What I understood was that there was something wrong with me that had — had — to be mastered. And for three decades I managed that struggle. And the relief and happiness of not having to do so any longer comes from others who fought for all of the measures advancing equality over the last five decades that are the precursors to today's Bill.""
 Crispin Blunt's speech prompted Mark Menzies to note he would change from abstaining to supporting the bill.
 Hugh Robertson closed the debate, praising the House for a ""lively and impassioned debate"" and stated the government's case: ""This is a bill with a very straightforward proposition at its heart: whether extending marriage for same-sex couples strengthens marriage and increases equality or whether it is a threat to religion and society. The Government believes it is the former.""
 According to media reports, more Conservative MPs voted against the Bill than for it in the second reading. Conservative MP Tim Loughton said: ""Apparently there's 132 Conservative MPs who voted in favour, so I think what we're going to see is that more Conservative MPs voted against this legislation than for it.""
 Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed the passage of the Second Reading, saying the legislation represents ""an important step forward for our country"".

"," The UK House of Commons voted yesterday to approve the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill at third reading, with 366 MPs supporting and 161 MPs opposing. The Bill proceeds today to the House of Lords. The legislation continues to draw strong criticism from right wing Conservative MPs and has caused political trouble for Prime Minister David Cameron.
 Opponents of the Bill led by Tim Loughton MP submitted an amendment to allow opposite sex couples to enter into civil partnerships, which were introduced in 2004 as an alternative to marriage for same sex couples. The government warned that Loughton's amendment was an attempt to wreck the passage of the Bill. Sir George Young, the Conservative chief whip, asked Labour whips to oppose the amendment despite the Labour Party previously supporting the amendment.
 A Labour Party source quoted in The Guardian said they ""had an eleventh hour appeal from the government that they did not have the numbers to defeat the Tim Loughton amendment"" and that Labour leader Ed Miliband considered it an ""overriding priority [...] to ensure that the bill gets on to the statute book. Ed and Yvette Cooper will therefore be voting against the Tim Loughton amendment. We expect a large number of MPs to join Ed and Yvette. Since there was a genuine threat to the bill Ed decided the best thing to do was to act in this way.""
 A rival amendment put forward by the Labour Party would bring in a review of whether civil partnerships ought to be extended to opposite sex couples but would not delay the implementation of marriage for same sex couples. This amendment was approved 391 to 57 by the Commons.
 Opponents of the Bill including David Burrowes and Peter Bone are hoping the House of Lords will reject the law: Burrowes stated Lords would have the right to reject the bill as ""there was no clear manifesto commitment, no coalition agreement, no green paper — just a sham consultation"". The Conservative Party's 2010 ""contract for equalities"" reads, ""We will also consider the case for changing the law to allow civil partnerships to be called and classified as marriage.""
 In an interview with The Big Issue, former cabinet minister and Conservative peer Norman Tebbit expressed concern about the possibility that a law legalising gay marriage would cause confusion regarding royal succession: ""When we have a queen who is a lesbian and she marries another lady and then decides she would like to have a child and someone donates sperm and she gives birth to a child, is that child heir to the throne?""
 Tebbit also argued the new law ""would lift my worries about inheritance tax because maybe I'd be allowed to marry my son. Why not? Why shouldn't a mother marry her daughter? Why shouldn't two elderly sisters living together marry each other?""
 During the debate, Gerald Howarth referred to Conservative MP Margot James as representative of an ""aggressive homosexual community"": ""I warn you, and MPs on all sides of the house, that I fear that the playing field has not been levelled. I believe that the pendulum is now swinging so far the other way and there are plenty in the aggressive homosexual community who see this as but a stepping stone to something even further"". Howarth's comments sparked a trending topic on the social networking site Twitter.
 David Cameron has been on the political defensive since rumours circulated that Conservative Party co-chairman Lord Feldman referred to Conservative activists as ""mad, swivel-eyed loons"". Conservative Grassroots chairman Miles Windsor remarked, ""This week has begun a civil war in conservatism, it may rumble on for years — but as things stand, Nigel Farage is winning it at a stride.""
 Maria Miller, the government minister responsible for equality, tweeted after the vote on the third reading: ""Just won Third Reading vote of Equal Marriage Bill - After all the hard work, its moment to be proud of. It's the Right Thing"". Labour MP Diane Abbott said: ""I did not think I would live to see the day this reached third reading.""
 On BBC Radio 4, David Cameron welcomed the passage of the bill: ""I think we should think about it like this — that there will be young boys in schools today who are gay, who are worried about being bullied, who are worried about what society thinks of them, who can see that the highest Parliament in the land has said that their love is worth the same as anybody else’s love and that we believe in equality. I think they will stand that bit taller today and I’m proud of the fact that that has happened.""

"," Speaking outside 10 Downing Street, the UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Tuesday her plans to seek a general election for June 8. May accused the opposition parties of threatening the government's Brexit agenda and cited the need for Parliament to unite during the negotiations over the specifics of the Brexit, the UK's exit from the European Union.
 Under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, members of Parliament must approve the snap election by a two-thirds vote in favor. The vote was held on Wednesday in the House of Commons, with the motion to hold an early election passing 522 to 13. 
 If her Conservative Party follows pollsters' expectations, May, who became Prime Minister after the resignation of David Cameron in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, would expand her majority in the House of Commons. The opposition Labour party is behind in the polls, at half the support of the Conservatives in a recently released poll by YouGov on behalf of The Times.
 The move was a reversal from previous statements, as the Prime Minister said earlier that an early election would not take place.

"," Today the Conservative Party, the current governing party of the United Kingdom (UK), announced Theresa May would become the new party leader following the decision by her leadership rival Andrea Leadsom to withdraw from the contest. This announcement was made on the same day it was confirmed a leadership contest has been formally triggered within the UK Labour Party, the official opposition, after Angela Eagle gathered the needed support to challenge Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the party.
 Following the withdrawal of Mrs Leadsom from the Conservative Party leadership election, Party official George Brady said he was expecting to appoint Mrs May as the new party leader. Mrs May, the current home secretary, would succeed David Cameron in this role, and it is expected she will also succeed him as Prime Minister. 
 Mrs Leadsom described a leadership election as ""highly undesirable"" for the country as she announced her decision to withdraw. She also said she felt she had insufficient support to win a leadership election.
 Mr Cameron originally announced his intention to resign following the UK EU referendum, and has now said he intends to offer his resignation following Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday.
 The Labour Party confirmed a leadership election had been officially triggered. Mrs Eagle has announced her candidacy, and it is understood she has the level of support from Labour Members of Parliament to add her name to the ballot.
 Mrs Eagle was one of many members of Mr Corbyn's Shadow Cabinet to resign following the EU Referendum. She today said Mr Corbyn ""is unable to provide the leadership"" needed as she launched her leadership bid. 
 It is unclear if Mr Corbyn's name will be automatically be added to the ballot as the current incumbent. A decision by the party's executive committee is reportedly to be made tomorrow to decide on the matter.

"," UK Prime Minister Theresa May yesterday announced the government's plans for how to proceed with the United Kingdom's exit, or ""Brexit"" (British exit), from the European Union. May stated the government would not seek to be a member of the European single market and would instead seek a new trade relationship. May said the UK government would seek access to the single market without retaining formal membership in it.
 May's speech stressed the need for friendliness between Britain and the EU but also ruled out any deal that did not allow the British government to control immigration, or which would require Britain to continue being bound by decisions of the European Court of Justice. In yesterday's speech, May also ruled out continued membership of the customs union as this prevented Britain from negotiating trade deals with non-EU countries.
 Theresa May also said Britain's contributions to the EU budget would cease, although some contributions would be made to some pan-European schemes. In her words, ""the days of Britain making vast contributions to the European Union every year will end"". The speech also covered the legal status of both UK citizens living abroad and EU citizens living in the UK. May said she wished to guarantee the status of both, but that she also sought ""reciprocity"" before doing so, and noted ""one or two"" other countries had not been willing to do so.
 Following May's speech the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, echoed the Prime Minister in a speech he gave to Parliament, adding ""the final deal agreed between the UK and the EU will be put to a vote in both Houses of Parliament before it takes effect"".
 Next week, on January 24, the Supreme Court is due to deliver a decision in a case challenging the government's right to issue Article 50—which starts the Brexit negotiations—without the consultation of Parliament.

"," Estimates by event organizers indicate roughly one million people marched in London on Saturday during an anti-Brexit (""British exit"") march, protesting the pending exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU).
 Protesters, carrying placards asking the government to revoke Article 50 — the EU treaty clause invoked by Brexit — and European Union flags, marched from Hyde Park Corner to Parliament. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, tweeted, ""Here in London, thousands of people from across our city and country have come together with @peoplesvote-uk to send a clear message: Enough is enough - it's time to give the British public the final say on Brexit.""
 There were several speakers at the rally, including First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, Labour MP (Member of Parliament) Tom Watson, and Sadiq Khan. Tom Watson called Prime Minister Theresa May's proposed Brexit deal ""lousy"" and said he would only vote for it if the British people could also vote for or against it. Nicola Sturgeon said it was ""the moment of maximum opportunity"" for stopping a no-deal Brexit.
 Some of the protesters Wikinews interviewed said they had gone to ""defend [their] children's right to live and work in Europe"" and ""secure [their own] right to work in the EU"". One interviewee said people changed their minds and several said they wanted the politicians to stop ignoring them.
 Not everyone agreed there should be another referendum. One MP told the BBC, ""We know that 16 million people wanted to stay in the EU, and some of those would still like to stay in the EU, and within that quite a few would like to have another go and have another referendum — but it was always a minority"".
 In 2016, the United Kingdom held a referendum on whether to remain part of the European union, which it joined in 1973. About 52% of participating voters voted to leave and 48% to stay.

"," According to the BBC, the Metropolitan Police Service of London in the United Kingdom announced today that its Specialist Crime Directorate will start an investigation into members of the U.K. Parliament, or MPs, who have been implicated in the on-going scandal about MPs' expense claims.  The investigation will be overseen by Janet Williams, a former special branch commander and run by the economic and specialist crime command unit.
 Since the The Daily Telegraph published details of MPs expenses, which ranged from a floating duck house to a pornographic movie for the husband of an MP, there has been public outrage at the claims. Many MPs have been forced to step down at the next general election.
 On Friday, Parliament published the list of MPs expenses that The Telegraph had received, but with many claims blacked out and redacted.  This in itself has provoked surprise and anger with the British public.
 The Met was quoted as saying ""After consideration by the joint Metropolitan Police and Crown Prosecution Service assessment panel the Met has decided to launch an investigation into the alleged misuse of expenses by a small number of MPs and Peers.""
 The police did not name any of the people who were to be investigated, but the BBC reported that through its own sources it had discovered that they included Labour members of the lower house of Parliament, the House of Commons, David Chaytor and Elliot Morley, and Labour member of the upper house of Parliament, the House of Lords, Baroness Uddin.
 Mr. Chaytor confirmed that the police had contacted his solicitor, and that he expected to be talking to the police within the next few days, to (in his words) ""explain my case, explain what happened"", and ""clear my name"".
 Any expenses claims made will be investigated to see whether they constitute offences.  Such offences are likely, by their natures, to be offences under the 2006 Fraud Act, in particular ""Fraud by false representation"", as defined in § 2 of the Act.  (This covers claims made over the past year, approximately.  Any expenses claimed prior to that Act coming into force would have to constitute offences under the Theft Act 1978.)  One consequence of this is that only those members of Parliament whose claims might have been dishonestly made will be subject to investigation.  
 The requirement, that the claim be dishonest for it to be fraud by false representation, means that any MPs' expense claims that correctly and honestly described what expenses were being claimed, or that were incorrect but not known by the MP to be incorrect when they were made, will not qualify as fraud according to law.  An expense claim for (for example) a floating duck house is not fraud under the Act if it really was for a floating duck house, as claimed.  Whereas an expense claim for (for example) payments for a mortgage that did not exist would qualify as fraud under the Act, subject to the additional requirement that the person making the expense claim knew that the mortgage that did not exist and thus was making a knowingly false representation about the thing being claimed for.

"," Calls for the ouster of British government minister Maria Miller have been increasing following a claim by the Daily Telegraph newspaper that Miller's special adviser used the threat of press regulation to try and prevent publication of a story about Miller's expenses. A poll published today by a number of newspapers shows a majority of the public unhappy with Miller's behaviour and saying she should be removed.
 The issue stems initially from a report in the Daily Telegraph regarding Miller's expenses claims to help pay a mortgage on a house in south London that Miller shares with her parents. The newspaper claimed that she had claimed £90,000 to pay the mortgage on the house. Miller's expenses have been the subject of investigation by a parliamentary commissioner and then by the House of Commons Committee on Standards. The commissioner determined she should repay £45,000 of this expense, but the Committee determined she ought to only repay £5,800. Following the decision of the Committee, the Daily Telegraph reported Miller's special adviser Joanna Hindley had said in a telephone call with the newspaper, ""I should just flag up as well, while you're on it that when she doorstepped him, she got Maria's father, who’s just had a [removed] and come out of [removed]. And Maria [has] obviously been having quite a lot of editors' meetings around Leveson at the moment. So I am just going to kind of flag up that connection for you to think about.""
 The Telegraph alleges that this was intended as a form of intimidation: that Hindley dropped in mention of press regulation and the Leveson Report as a way to attempt to get the newspaper to drop the story. A leader column in the Telegraph stated Hindley's remarks were ""an indictment of the influence that press regulation by statute could have over free speech"". Therese Coffey, a Conservative MP (Member of Parliament), has defended Hindley's statements to the Telegraph, as specifically referring to the ""doorstepping"" of Maria Miller's elderly parents, specifically her father who had been returning from hospital. Coffey said of the audio published by the Telegraph: ""I heard an adviser to the culture secretary suggesting that it's inappropriate to be doorstepping elderly parents of somebody who has just come out of hospital.""
 Heather Brooke, a campaigner who has been involved in the release and publication of MPs' expenses and the scandal that followed, said the alleged doorstepping was ""a public interest piece of reporting"", noting that the journalist from the Telegraph had to visit the property to work out who was living there. Brooke said it was ""disingenuous to use this argument of privacy"".
 Telegraph editor Tony Gallagher also claimed that Craig Oliver, David Cameron's director of communications, also attempted to suppress the story: ""When you get the Prime Minister's spokesman making a similar phone call to you a couple of days later, you add all three calls up and you can only conclude that they are trying to harass you and stop you from publishing the story.""
 Oliver has denied the story. ""It is utterly false to suggest that I threatened Tony Gallagher over Leveson in any way. The conversation I had with him was about the inappropriate doorstepping of an old man"", he told the BBC.
 Miller has the backing of Prime Minister David Cameron: on Friday, Cameron told reporters to ""leave it there"" on questions of Miller's expenses. Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, suggested Miller could be targeted by a ""witch-hunt"" due to her role in press regulation following the Leveson inquiry, as well as her job in fronting the government's gay marriage bill.
 Duncan Smith told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""I am enormously fond of her. She has done a very good job in a very difficult set of circumstances with the Leveson inquiry that has stirred up a lot of media antipathy to her. And also the gay marriage stuff — there are a lot of Conservatives out there who, perhaps, were not necessarily in support of it all and so feel rather bitter about that. I have known her to be a reasonable and honest person.""
 Labour politicians have responded to the affair with strong criticism of Miller, but no call yet to resign. Angela Eagle, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, said: ""The latest revelations and the release of a recording raise further serious questions for Maria Miller and David Cameron. They urgently need to make clear what they knew about these calls and what action they took about them.""

"," In the latest developments in discussions between the Liberal Democrats and the two largest parties, Gordon Brown has announced his resignation as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister.
 Gordon Brown made his statement at 5.00 pm local time in front of 10 Downing Street, London, following a meeting he had yesterday with Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party.
 He stated that a strong and stable ""progressive alliance"" of the Labour and Liberal parties would be in the best interest of the country and made his resignation as a means to forward this, saying that he would set in motion the process needed for a new leader of the Labour Party to be selected and that a new leader will be in place in the autumn by the time of the next Labour Party Conference.
 However, unlike a Conservative-Liberal alliance, a Labour-Liberal one would not command a majority in Parliament.  For the ""progressive alliance"" to have its majority, it would therefore need to bring in MPs from the smaller parties, something that both the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru have stated they would be amenable to.
 The current move follows the return of a hung parliament in the United Kingdom general election on Thursday. The Liberal Democratic Party, who hold the balance of power, have been in negotiations with the Conservative Party.

"," A day after general elections were held in the UK, results indicate there will be a hung parliament — where no party obtains the simple majority needed to pass legislation on its own — raising the prospect of a minority or coalition government being formed, which would require cooperation between parties.
 With only one constituency not yet counted, David Cameron's Conservatives have taken 306 seats, incumbent Prime Minister Gordon Brown's Labour party 258 seats, and Nick Clegg with his Liberal Democrats with 57. Cameron has said he will negotiate with the latter party to try and form a coalition to attain more than 325 seats, or half those in the parliament.
 After Labour's large losses at the polls yesterday, both in terms of seats and votes, Cameron said Brown has ""lost his mandate to govern"". Clegg, meanwhile, says he thinks the result allows the Conservatives to try to form a government first, contrary to past tradition, under which the incumbent prime minister and his party in a hung parliament try first to form a coalition.
 ""I've said that whichever party gets the most votes and the most seats, if not an absolute majority, has the first right to seek to govern either on its own or by reaching out to other parties, and I stick to that view,"" Clegg said this morning.
 ""It seems this morning that it is the Conservative Party that has more votes and more seats though not an absolute majority. That is why I think it is now for the Conservative Party to prove that it is capable of seeking to govern in the national interest.""
 Clegg described his party's performance as ""disappointing"" during the night, as they had failed to make any significant advances in their target seats. Overall, the general swing varied, with all parties failing to gain many of their targets, and suffering unexpected losses in others.
 Pre-empting a statement from Cameron, Brown said at lunchtime in a short statement outside Downing Street that if any negotiations between the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats failed, he would be prepared to form an alliance with Nick Clegg, offering ""far-reaching political reform"", in reference to the Liberals' long held position that the UK's first past the post voting system must be reformed into some form of proportional representation system, historically opposed by the Conservatives.
 ""I understand and completely respect the position of Mr. Clegg in stating that he wishes first to make contact with the leader of the Conservative Party,"" he commented, but noting that, ""should the discussions between Mr. Cameron and Mr. Clegg come to nothing [...] I would be prepared to discuss with Mr. Clegg the areas where there may be some measure of agreement between our two parties."" He said there is ""substantial common ground"" between his party and the Liberals.
 ""I understand as I know my fellow party leaders do that people do not like the uncertainty or want it to be prolonged. We live, however, in a parliamentary democracy, the outcome has been delivered by the electorate. It is our responsibility now to make it work for the national good,"" Brown said.
 Cameron made his position known in a statement delivered in the early afternoon, in which he offered the prospect of both a Lib Dem supported minority Conservative government, or an alliance ""stronger, more stable, more collaborative government than that"". Cameron stated: ""I want to make a big, open and comprehensive offer to the Liberal Democrats. I want us to work together in tackling our country's big and urgent problems — the debt crisis, our deep social problems, and our broken political system.""
 He went on to describe how both parties had ""common ground"" they could work together on to form a government in the ""national interest"". On the issue of electoral reform, Cameron ruled out holding a referendum, but suggested forming an all party commission on electoral and voting reform. He also ruled out concessions on other Lib Dem positions like greater integration with the European Union or altering the position on defence and the nuclear deterrent, although offering to adopt other Lib Dem policies, such as on schools.
 The AFP news agency says this is the first time the Liberal Democrats have considered working with Conservatives; previously, the former were thought likelier to negotiate with Labour due to them being considered more ""progressive"". 
 Brown, however, has made it clear he has no intention of stepping down as PM, saying he has ""a duty as Prime Minister to take all steps to ensure Britain has a strong, stable and principled government"".
 Business Secretary Lord Mandelson commented on the matter, saying: ""The Prime Minister's duty is to stay at his post, to continue doing his job and not resign until it is clear who the Queen should call as an alternative to form a new government, should Mr Brown not be able to do so.""
 When asked whether it was ""inconceivable"" that the PM should step down, Mandelson responded: ""Frankly, there are quite a number of permutations. And the reason I don't want to start getting into hypotheses about what may or may not happen is because, quite frankly, I think it's premature. I am not ruling out or ruling in anything.""
 Under British parliamentary convention, in the event of a hung parliament, Brown remains Prime Minister and the Labour Government continues to operate until it is demonstrated it cannot command a majority. The Government effectively gave approval for talks to begin by giving civil servants permission to support all parties in hung parliament negotiations. Brown described how the negotiations could be ""prolonged"", and while recognising people might want a swift conclusion, ""the outcome has been delivered by the electorate. It is our responsibility now to make it work for the national good"".

"," The British government formally published legislation today to allow marriage for same-sex couples. The bill is titled the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill. MPs would be able to vote on the legislation at the second reading in Parliament on February 5.
 Maria Miller, the Culture Secretary, said of the legislation to BBC Radio 4: ""We feel that marriage is a good thing and we should be supporting more couples to marry."" Gay and lesbian couples have been allowed since 2005 to form civil partnerships.
 The Coalition for Equal Marriage, a campaign group supporting the legalisation of same-sex marriage, have tracked support by individual MPs and claim 336 MPs are likely to vote in favour of the legislation, while 130 are likely to vote against. Conservative MPs are to be given a free vote, but both Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs are broadly in support.
 As part of the legislation, the government have included a set of provisions they describe as a ""quadruple lock"" against churches and other religious denominations being forced to perform  same-sex  weddings, including an explicit ban on the Church of England and the Church of Wales doing so. The ""quadruple lock"" consists of an explicit statement in the Bill ""that no religious organisation, or individual minister, can be forced to marry same-sex couples or to permit that to happen on their premises"", an amendment to the Equality Act 2010 to prevent claims of discrimination against religious organisations for not performing same-sex weddings, an opt-in for religious groups who do wish to perform same-sex marriages, and the explicit ban for the Churches of England and Wales.
 Maria Miller said the government recognises ""that some churches won't want to participate in same-sex marriages. We are trying to make sure that there are the protections there for churches who feel that this isn't appropriate for their particular beliefs. We know that there are churches who do want to take part in same-sex marriages, so we have made sure that there are provisions there so they can.""
 Former defence secretary Liam Fox, opposing the legislation, has suggested the European Court of Human Rights will overrule the government's protections for churches. He argued earlier this month: ""Any assurances that we are given that distinguishing between churches will not be used at some point by European courts to drive a coach and horses through the legislation carries little credibility with those of us who have watched similar assurances trounced in the past.""
 The Roman Catholic Church has strongly opposed the measures. Archbishop Vincent Nichols has said he is ""very disappointed"" the government is pushing for same-sex marriage and claimed it would ""weaken"" the institution. The Archbishop also claimed of the legislation: ""[t]here was no announcement in any party manifesto"". However, the Conservative Party's ""contract for equalities"" for the 2010 election included a statement saying they would ""consider"" same-sex marriage: ""We will also consider the case for changing the law to allow civil partnerships to be called and classified as marriage.""
 A Guardian/ICM poll conducted in December 2012 found 62% of the British public favour allowing same-sex marriage.

"," The UK government plans to replace the House of Lords, the upper house of British Parliament, with a duly elected one to make it ""legitimate.""  Ministers working on this proposal plan to style this new chamber loosely on the United States Senate.
 Transport Secretary Lord Andrew Adonis said on a BBC show, ""The time has now come to make it legitimate in the only way that a legislative assembly can be legitimate in the modern world, which is to be elected."" He assured that there would be ""firm proposals"" for an elected House of Lords in the Labour Party's manifesto for the general election in May. He added ""We can do it in this country as most democracies do it: We'd have two chambers, both of which are elected but with the government accountable to the first chamber.""
 The Sunday Telegraph has leaked a plan which reveals that the 704 seats would be reduced to 300 seats and its members elected under a system of ""proportional representation"". This new chamber would no longer be known as the House of Lords and citizens will have the privilege to remove incompetent members through a ""recall ballot"". The paper reported that each member would serve up to fifteen years and one-third of the chamber would be elected during the usual general elections. The salary is reported to be around £65,000 per annum. All members should be UK residents and fully domiciled for tax purposes.
 The Lords scrutinise and revise government legislation and are seen by the public as an undemocratic house or a place for the aristocrats and political appointees.  The chamber currently has around 740 members.  92 hold hereditary seats, and 26 are Church of England clergy.  The rest are appointed for life.
 Former prime minister Tony Blair, with the 1999 House of Lords act, had expelled hereditary peers from the upper house, apart from the 92 permitted to remain in the House on an interim basis.  Another ten inheritors were created life peers to be able to remain in the House.  Lord Adonis commented that this expulsion had ""fundamentally transformed"" the chamber into a ""workmanlike assembly"".
 A spokesman for the Conservative Party (which is the opposition party) alleged that Labour was playing politics with the electoral system by introducing such proposals before the General election despite having thirteen years to reform the Lords.  ""We will work to build a consensus for a mainly elected second chamber to replace the House of Lords,"" he added.
 For centuries, the House of Lords had included several hundred members who inherited their seats; the 1999 Act removed such a right.  The Act decreased the membership of the House from 1,330 to 669.  The Labour Government is expected to present a bill to remove the remaining 92 hereditary peers from the House.  It also introduced in 2009 the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, which would end by-elections to replace hereditaries, removing them by steady reduction instead of removing all of them outright.

"," The United Kingdom House of Commons voted 272–285 last night against proposed possible military action against Syria following claims the Assad regime used chemical weapons against civilians. The government motion was defeated by opposition from the Labour Party, as well as rebel MPs from both the Conservative and Liberal Democratic parties.
 David Cameron argued the recent events in Syria were a ""humanitarian catastrophe, and if there are no consequences for it, there is nothing to stop Assad and other dictators from using these weapons again and again"". The motion rejected by the Commons said the House ""agrees that a strong humanitarian response is required from the international community and that this may, if necessary, require military action"", and such action would be ""legal, proportionate and focused on saving lives by preventing and deterring further use of Syria's chemical weapons"".
 Thirty Conservative MPs and nine Liberal Democrats voted against their party against military intervention. Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said the proposal to go to war was an ""ill-thought through action"", it lacked international support, and Cameron had acted in a ""cavalier and reckless"" manner.
 Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democratic leader Nick Clegg said the sole intention of the government's motion was to ""relieve humanitarian suffering by deterring and disrupting the further use of chemical weapons. Nothing more, nothing less. Not invasion. Not regime change... President Obama's intentions are highly limited and so are ours.""
 The former foreign secretary and Conservative MP Sir Malcolm Rifkind said during the debate: ""The Assad regime in Damascus are watching very carefully as to whether they will get away with what they have done.""
 Opposition came also from Britain's smaller parties: Caroline Lucas from the Green Party said the actions ""cannot be justified"", and expressed concern that the United Kingdom would be ""flouting international law"" by going into Syria. Respect MP George Galloway argued there was ""no compelling evidence"" of Syrian government involvement in the chemical weapons attack.
 Labour proposed an opposing motion that called for the government to present ""compelling"" evidence before action, which was rejected as well as the government's motion. The defeat of the government motion for military intervention has surprised some. Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said ""Parliament is entirely unpredictable sometimes and I don't think many people saw this coming.""
 Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, confirmed that following the vote, the country would not participate in any action in Syria, but he noted he expected the United States to carry on without the UK, anticipating ""the US and other countries will continue to look at responses to the chemical attack. They will be disappointed that Britain will not be involved. I don't expect that the lack of British participation will stop any action.""
 Hammond noted the rejection of military intervention would strain the ""special relationship"" between Britain and the United States.
 The former leader of the British Army, General Lord Dannatt, said the vote in the Commons was a ""victory for common sense"".
 The United States has said they will still seek military action against the Syrian regime. US defense secretary Chuck Hagel said the US would seek to build an ""international coalition"". Caitlin Hayden, spokeswoman for the White House, reacted to the British vote by saying: ""The US will continue to consult with the UK Government — one of our closest allies and friends.""
 Hayden said that President Obama ""will be guided by what is in the best interests of the United States"", and that Obama ""believes that there are core interests at stake for the United States... countries who violate international norms regarding chemical weapons need to be held accountable"".
 Representative Eliot Engel, a Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the White House had told them ""beyond a doubt [...] chemical weapons were used, and used intentionally by the Assad regime"", and that there is evidence from intercepted communications of involvement by ""high-level Syrian officials"".
 The Parliamentary vote on intervention in Syria is on the front pages of many of the national newspapers in Britain, with The Times claiming Cameron was ""humiliated"" by the vote.

"," The Speaker of the British House of Commons, the Right Honourable Michael Martin MP, told Parliament that he will ""relinquish the office of Speaker on Sunday, 21st June"". This preempts a vote of confidence in him that was scheduled later this week. He will also step down as the Member of Parliament for Glasgow North East, which will cause a by-election.
 In his statement to Parliament, Martin said he is standing down ""in order that unity can be maintained,"" as he believes ""that the House is at its best when it is united.""
 Martin, Speaker since 2000, yesterday made a statement to the House of Commons, when he apologised both personally and on behalf of the House over the recent scandal involving the expenses of Members of Parliament.
 David Miliband, the British Foreign Secretary, then took questions, and noted the House would give tributes at a later date, as the Speaker said he had nothing else to say on the subject. Bob Spink, Independant MP for Castle Point, however, gave the Speaker ""the warmest possible tribute,"" a sentiment shared by other members who cried ""hear hear.""
 On the other hand, Nick Robinson, political editor for the BBC, said on his blog that ""in the end, he had no choice"" but to resign and claimed ""he failed to see this crisis coming.""
 This is the first time since 1695 that a Speaker has been effectively forced out of office, when Sir John Trevor was found guilty of accepting a bribe.

"," Following the resignation of Speaker Michael Martin, which took effect yesterday, members of the House of Commons, the lower house of the British Houses of Parliament, today elected John Bercow as the new Speaker of the House.
 The three rounds of voting were held as a secret ballot of all Members of the Commons. Each round eliminated from subsequent rounds any candidates with less than 5% support, with the winner to be the candidate who, in any round, achieved a simple majority of the vote. This was a new system for electing the Speaker, and the first time that the Speaker has been elected by secret ballot.
 In the first round of voting, there were 10 candidates: Margaret Beckett, Sir George Young, Ann Widdecombe, Sir Alan Beith, John Bercow, Richard Shepherd, Sir Michael Lord, Sir Patrick Cormack, Sir Alan Haselhurst, and Parmjit Dhanda.  All candidates made brief speeches in the chamber at 13:30 UTC (14:30 BST) immediately before the vote.
 Four candidates were eliminated by this round — Cormack, Dhanda, Lord, and Shepherd — leaving six candidates to go forward to the second round of voting.
 In the second round, Widdecombe was eliminated, leaving five candidates to go forward to the third.  All candidates apart from Bercow and Young lost ground.  Young gained more votes than Bercow, but Bercow remained in the lead.
 In the third round, all remaining candidates except two, Bercow and Young, withdrew from the contest, after an appeal to do so from the Father of the House, Alan Williams.  This appeal was motivated by the length of each round of voting, which required 600 ballot papers to be printed, marked, and counted.
 In both the first and second rounds of voting, one ballot was spoiled.  Although the ballot was secret and the identity of the person whose ballot it was could thus not be confirmed, John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, claimed it was him. ""None of them have got a strong reforming agenda,"" said Mann. ""Some of the speeches were shocking, after what we have been through recently.""
 After confirmation by a unanimous acclamation, with no ""noes"" voiced, John Bercow became the Speaker-elect for the 157th Speaker of the House of Commons. In accordance with tradition, he was physically dragged to the chair. At 19:31 UTC (20:31 BST) he delivered a 5 minute speech, paying tribute to the other candidates, before sitting in the chair itself.  In that speech he paid tribute to his mother, pointing out that she had taken a keen interest in proceedings.
 He also said: ""I want just to say this about the responsibility of the office. The Speaker has the responsibility to immediately and permanently cast aside all his or her previous political views. I said it —"".  Here he was interrupted by members anticipating the end of his sentence, and calls to ""come and join the Labour Party"".  He resumed ""I said it and I meant it. My promise to this house is to be completely impartial, that is what it's about. I will do my best faithfully, honourably and respectfully to do my best in the months ahead.""
 His first three acts as Speaker-elect were to call upon the Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the Leader of the Opposition David Cameron, and the leader of the Liberal Democrats Nick Clegg to speak. Brown and Cameron both commented upon Bercow's hobby of playing tennis, with Brown observing that Bercow had now permanently taken the position of umpire. The Prime Minister said that on the matter of Bercow's casting aside of his past political views, ""some of us thought you had done that some time ago"". Cameron also pointed out that Bercow was the first Jewish Speaker to be elected by the House in its history.
 Cameron and Clegg both reminded Bercow of the comments made by Parmjit Dhanda, who had said in his candidacy speech earlier that afternoon: ""All of the 10 (candidates) is capable of doing the job but … do we all really get it? Do we understand the level of crisis out there. Do we understand the level of public’s anger.""
 Bercow's election as Speaker elect remained subject to Royal Approbation. This was not given in person by the Queen.
 At 20:51 UTC (21:51 BST), the Lords Commissioners assembled on the Woolsack in the House of Lords, and summoned the House of Commons via Black Rod, who in turn summoned the Commons at 20:54 UTC (21:54 BST). The clerk of the House of Lords read the Royal Commission, authorizing the Lords Commissioners to speak in the name of the Queen. At 21:01 UTC (22:01 BST) the Lord Chancellor Jack Straw, spoke for the Lords Commissioners and declared Bercow to be the Speaker of the House of Commons.
 Bercow's first act as Speaker, after returning to the Commons and formally notifying it of events in the Lords, at 21:06 UTC (22:06 BST) was to call upon the Leader of the House, Harriet Harman.  She proposed a motion, carried by acclamation without dissent, for the Commons to call upon the Queen to elevate the previous Speaker, Michael Martin, to the House of Lords. Bercow's second act was again to call upon Harman, who proposed a motion to adjourn, again carried by acclamation without dissent.

"," On Tuesday, the United Kingdom Parliament started five days of debates ahead of a vote over Prime Minister Theresa May's deal to leave the European Union.
 The deal being debated is a withdrawal agreement for the United Kingdom (UK)'s exit from the European Union (EU), and a political framework defining ambitions for the future of the UK–EU relationship.
 In a statement to the House of Commons shortly before debates began, Theresa May said ""I have spent nearly two years negotiating this deal [...] I have lost valued colleagues along the way, I have faced fierce criticism from all sides. If I had banged the table, walked out of the room, and at the end of the process delivered the very same deal that is before us today, some might say that I'd done a better job.""
 Following the debates, a vote in the House of Commons is to determine if the deal will be implemented. The vote is scheduled for next Tuesday, December 11.

"," The controversial plan to raise university tuition fees in England and Wales will be voted on in the House of Commons on Thursday, December 9. The policy has been the cause of protests across the United Kingdom by students, some of which have turned violent. It has also been a source of considerable criticism and political difficulties for the Liberal Democrats and has raised questions as to the long-term viability of the Coalition government.
 The new policy on tuition fees will allow universities to double the current tuition fees from £3,290 per year to around £6,000 per year, as well as allowing some universities to get special approval from the Office For Fair Access (OFFA) to raise their fees to £9,000 per year. If passed, the new fee structure will apply starting in the academic year of 2012/2013. The vote on Thursday will only be on the fee rise, with other matters being voted on in the new year following publication of a new higher education white paper.
 In addition to increasing fees, the policy will increase the payment threshold at which payment is made. It is currently set at £15,000 and will rise to £21,000, but the interest rate will also rise. It is currently 1.5% but will now vary from between 0% and 3% plus inflation (using the Retail Price Index).
 The fee increase follows the publication of an independent review by Lord Browne, former chief executive of BP, a process started by Peter Mandelson, the former Business Secretary. Before the election, two main options were mooted for funding reform in higher education: either an increase in tuition fees or a graduate tax. The Browne Review endorsed the former and the findings of the Review form the basis of the government's policy. The graduate tax was supported by the Liberal Democrats before the election, and in the Labour leadership elections it was supported by Ed Balls and the winner of the leadership election, Ed Milliband.
 Conservative members of the Coalition intend to vote for the reform, and the Labour opposition have been vociferous critics of the rise in fees, despite the previous government's introduction of top-up fees. The Liberal Democratic members of the Coalition have been left in a politically difficult position regarding the fee hike and have been target of much criticism from protesters. Liberal Democrats have opposed the rise in tuition fees: their party manifesto included a commitment to ending tuition fees within six years, and many signed a pledge organised by the National Union of Students to not vote for any increase in tuition fees.
 The Coalition agreement allows Liberal Democrats to opt to abstain on votes for a number of policies including tuition fees. Many Liberal Democrats are expected to abstain, and a few MPs have stated that they will vote against it including former party leader Sir Menzies Campbell, and the recently elected party president Tim Farron, as well as a number of Liberal Democrat back-benchers. Liberal Democrat party leaders have said that they will act collectively, but the BBC have said senior Liberal Democrats have admitted in private that government whips will not be able to force all Liberal Democrats to vote for the policy.
 On Tuesday, the Liberal Democrats parliamentary party will meet in the Commons to decide on their collective position. If all ministers decide to vote for the policy, it will probably pass, but if only cabinet ministers (and maybe parliamentary private secretaries) vote for the policy, there is considerable risk of it not passing. If the Coalition does not manage to get the policy through Parliament, it will fuel doubts about the continued effectiveness and viability of the government.
 How deputy prime minister Nick Clegg and business secretary Vince Cable vote has been of considerable controversy. Although under the Coalition agreement, they are allowed to abstain, suggestions of doing so have prompted criticism. It was suggested last week that Cable may abstain even though as business secretary he is directly responsible for higher education policy, and has been heavily involved in designing the proposals. Cable has said that Liberal Democrat support of the tuition fee changes has allowed them to push it in a more ""progressive"" direction.
 Cable has now decided that he will vote for the policy, and argues that the policy has ""a lot of protection for students from low income backgrounds and graduates who have a low income or take time out for family"". He also believes ""there's common consensus that the system we've devised is a progressive one"".
 ""Dr Cable has performed so many U-turns over the issue of university funding that he is spinning on his heels,"" said National Union of Students president Aaron Porter. ""That may stand him in good stead with the Strictly Come Dancing judges but the electorate will see it differently.""
 Former deputy prime minister John Prescott joked on Twitter that ""On tuition fees we've noticed Vince Cable's remarkable transformation in the last few weeks from stalling to Mr In Between""—a reference to a previous attack Prescott made on Gordon Brown as having transformed from ""Stalin to Mr Bean"".
 On Question Time this week, Liberal Democrat treasury secretary Danny Alexander also confirmed he is prepared to vote for the policy but delegated the question to the meeting of Liberal Democrats on Tuesday.
 The politics of the tuition fee debate may also affect the by-election taking place in Oldham East and Saddleworth following the removal of Phil Woolas, where Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates will both be standing for the first by-election following the formation of the Coalition government.
 Opposition to the policy has become the focus for a large number of protests across the country by both current university students, many school pupils and political allies of the student movement.
 On November 10, between 30,000 and 52,000 protesters from across Britain marched through central London in a demonstration organised by the National Union of Students and the University and College Union, which represents teachers and lecturers in further and higher education. At the November 10 protest, a number of people occupied Millbank Tower, an office block which houses the Conservative Party. Fifty people were arrested and fourteen were injured. NUS president Aaron Porter condemned the attack and said it was caused by ""those who are here to cause trouble"", and that the actions of a ""minority of idiots"" shouldn't ""undermine 50,000 who came to make a peaceful protest"".
 Following the November 10 march, other protests have taken place across the country including an occupation at the University of Manchester, a sit-in at the John Owens Building in Manchester, and a demonstration at the University of Cambridge. A protest was also run outside the offices of The Guardian where Nick Clegg—who was giving a lecture inside the building—was executed in effigy while students protested ""Nick Clegg, shame on you, shame on you for turning blue"" (blue is the colour of the Conservative Party).
 On November 24, a large number of protests took place across the country including a mass walk-out from universities and schools organised on Facebook, numerous university occupations, and demonstrations in Manchester, Cambridge, Birmingham, Leeds, Brighton and Cardiff, and a well-publicised occupation of University College London.
 In London, a protest was planned to march down Whitehall to Parliament, but police held protesters in Trafalgar Square until they eventually broke free and ran around in a game of ""cat and mouse"" along the side streets around Charing Cross Road, Covent Garden and Picadilly Circus.
 Simon Hardy from the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts described the police response including the controversial 'kettling' of protesters as ""absolutely outrageous"". Green MP Caroline Lucas raised the police response including the use of kettling in the House of Commons and stated that it was ""neither proportionate, nor, indeed, effective"".
 On November 30, protests continued in London culminating in 146 arrests of protesters in Trafalgar Square, and protests in Cardiff, Cambridge, Newcastle, Bath, Leeds, Sheffield, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Belfast, Brighton, Manchester and Bristol. Protesters in Sheffield attempted to invade and occupy Nick Clegg's constituency office. Occupations of university buildings started or continued at University College London, Newcastle University, Cambridge University and Nottingham University, as well as council buildings in Oxford and Birmingham.
 A ""day of action"" is being planned on December 8, the day before the Commons vote, by the National Union of Students.

"," Conservative United Kingdom MP Nadine Dorries is to face an investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards over her decision to appear on the reality television show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!. Earlier this week, the chief whip Sir George Young suspended the whip (expelled her from the party) until she returns to the United Kingdom.
 Today on ITV's This Morning, David Cameron defended the suspension of the whip: ""The chief whip took the view – and I back this completely – that she had made the decision to go out and do this programme and that meant she couldn't be in parliament, she couldn't represent her constituents and I think people do expect MPs to be doing either one or two of those things, particularly when parliament is sitting"".
 Dorries is to appear on the show alongside a variety of actors and actresses, sportsmen and entertainers including Helen Flanagan from Coronation Street, Charlie Brooks from EastEnders, Hugo Taylor from Made in Chelsea, Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather, Colin Baker from Doctor Who, Ashley Roberts (formerly of the Pussycat Dolls), darts champion Eric Bristow, boxer David Haye and comedian Brian Conley. Dorries could earn £40,000 from her appearance and could potentially spend up to a month away in Australia. The show features a variety of challenges including ""gross-out"" segments where the celebrity participants eat things such as insects, kangaroo testicles, and crocodile penises.
 Dorries has defended her appearance on the show, telling the Daily Mail earlier in the week: ""I'm doing the show because 16 million people watch it. Rather than MPs talking to other MPs about issues in Parliament, I think MPs should be going to where people go. I'm not going in there to upset people, but I have opinions. There are certain causes that I'm interested in, one of which is '20 Weeks'"" (a reference to her view that the legal limit for abortion should be reduced from 24 to 20 weeks). ""I will be talking about this issue around the campfire. I hope there will be some lively, heated debates.""
 Dorries later stated that her participation in the show would allow people to see that normal people can be politicians. ""A lot of people don't vote and if they can see I am a normal mother who comes from a poor background and who didn't go to a posh school, they may think they can be a politician too. Maybe they will trust us more.""
 A variety of political figures have criticised Dorries for choosing to go on the show. The health secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""A lot of people are very worried about it. And I think we want MPs where they should be, voting in the House of Commons."" Louise Mensch wrote an editorial for The Guardian lambasting Dorries: ""Eating grubs and performing humiliating tasks on air are not consistent with being an MP – unless you're retired, or desperate.""
 The retired MP Ann Widdecombe, who appeared while an MP in Celebrity Fit Club and, after retiring, in Strictly Come Dancing, called the suspension ""loony"": ""Why on earth couldn't they have said it is a matter between Dorries and her constituents and left it at that? Silly, silly idiots.""
 On Twitter, Conservative MPs have reacted, with Claire Perry making a joke at Dorries's expense: ""I'm not fit to be an MP – kick me out of here"".

"," On Monday, United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak revealed in a media briefing that he will confirm in his Budget, scheduled for half-noon Wednesday, an end to the partial pay freeze on 2.6 million public sector employees introduced last November, alongside a 6.6% increase to the National Living Wage.
 Mr Sunak used the fall in wages during COVID-19 to justify his ""pause"" in public sector employees' pay that exempted 2.9 million National Health Service workers and those earning under GBP24 thousand per year, but applied to 2.6 million teachers, police, civil servants and members of the British Armed Forces. While a pay rise is in order from spring next year, the precise details are pending consultation by independent advisers and pay review bodies, according to the i.  The Guardian writes some 5.7 million public sector employees could see a pay rise. 
 In addition, about two million on minimum wage, including some from the above 5.7 million, could benefit from an increase in the national minimum and national living wages.  According to the i and The Guardian, the National Living Wage applicable for over-23s will increase by 59p to GBP9.50 an hour from next April, about GBP1000 for a full-time worker, in line with recommendations from independent advisory board the Low Pay Commission.  The National Minimum Wage for those aged 21 to 22 will rise 82p to GBP9.18 an hour, and the Apprenticeship Rate will go up 51p to GBP4.81 an hour.
 However, according to senior research economist at the Institute for Fiscal Studies Tom Waters: ""While this boosts earnings for full-time minimum wage workers by over £1,000 a year, those on universal credit will see their disposable income go up by just £250 because their taxes rise and benefit receipt falls as their earnings increase.""  Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury and Labour MP Bridget Phillipson said the offer was ""underwhelming"", and ""[m]uch of it will be swallowed up by the government’s tax rises, universal credit cuts and failure to get a grip on energy bills"".  UK inflation rose 2.9% the year to September, according to the Office of National Statistics.
 Phillipson contrasted Sunak's measures with those of a Labour government, according to The Independent: ""With a new deal for workers, exploitative practices like zero hours contracts banned, Fire and rehire outlawed, a minimum wage of at least £10 an hour and fair pay agreements, a Labour government will transform work and raise standards.""
 However, the Daily Mirror says Mr Sunak is considering a rise to GBP10.50 an hour, and the qualifying age for the National Living Wage lowered from 25 to 21 by the next election in 2024.  This would match or exceed Labour's pledge of ""a decent income that you can raise a family on"": an increase of the ""minimum wage to at least £10 an hour"".
 Mr Sunak said during the media briefing that Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle would later call ""riding roughshod"" over parliamentarians, that it was ""[t]he economic impact and uncertainty of the virus"" that led to the ""difficult decision to pause private pay"", which ""[a]long with our Plan for Jobs, this action helped us protect livelihoods at the height of the pandemic.  And now, with the economy firmly back on track, it’s right that nurses, teachers and all the other public-sector workers who played their part during the pandemic see their wages rise.""
 Prime Minister Boris Johnson had announced at the Conservative Party conference his intent to create a ""high-pay, high-skill economy"" after Brexit, but it may take years for salary growth to catch up with mounting financial pressures, according to the i.
 According to The Guardian, analysis by the Resolution Foundation indicates those impacted by the freeze earned nearly 8% less than their private sector counterparts.  The differential widened to 0.6% for all public sector employees, including those exempt.  The Office of National Statistics writes total private sector pay grew 8.3% from June to August 2021, while public sector pay grew only 2.5%.

"," Per request of United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Queen suspended parliament for five weeks yesterday. The move, called prorogation, came after a second motion for snap elections failed to pass. The United Kingdom is in the process of leaving the European Union which has been termed Brexit for ""British exit"".
 Monday's bid for October elections failed to get the two-thirds majority required. According to the BBC, it is commonplace for new governments — Johnson became prime minister in July — to suspend parliament, but apparently using it as a tool in his Brexit strategy has been controversial. Parliament is to remain out-of-session through October 14; the Brexit deadline is October 31.
 The United Kingdom voted on June 23, 2016, to leave the European Union in the Brexit referendum. The original deadline to leave was extended previously to its current date, but it is Johnson's stated intent for the UK to leave with or without a trade deal with the EU and not seek any further extensions. 
 ""[W]e must get Brexit done, because the UK must come out [...] by October 31st, or else I fear that permanent damage will be done in the UK to trust our democratic system"", Johnson said in a video statement released in conjunction with a visit to Ireland with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.
 During these five weeks of prorogation, parliament cannot pass legislation, as no votes, debates or Prime Minister's Questions can take place. Members of the House of Commons protested by shouting ""shame on you!"" and holding signs which read ""silenced"" during Monday's final session.
 Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said his Labour Party ""[are] eager for an election — but as keen as we are, we are not prepared to risk inflicting the disaster of no deal on our communities, our jobs, our services, or indeed our rights"".
 Johnson asked Queen Elizabeth II for this prorogation in August. Johnson became leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister after Theresa May stepped down on July 24 after she was unable to negotiate a Brexit deal.

"," The United Kingdom Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Tony Blair PC MP, at 09:00 UTC today formally requested the Queen to dissolve Parliament on April 11, thereby confirming May 5 to be the date for the next General Election.
 Mr Blair had delayed the formal request for the dissolution of Parliament for 1 day, as a mark of respect for Pope John Paul II, who died on Saturday April 2.  All political parties had suspended campaiging for two days; and Mr Blair and other politicians had been attending services to mourn the death of the Pope.  
 The wedding of His Royal Highness Prince Charles had previously been scheduled for Friday April 8, and hence Members of Parliament (Lords and Commons) would have not sat on that day and would have stopped sitting on Thursday April 7.  However, because of that subsequently being the date set for the funeral of Pope John Paul II, the wedding has been postponed to Saturday April 9.  
 Members of Parliament (Lords and Commons) will thus stop sitting on Friday April 8.  This leaves just four days for all remaining legislation to be passed.  It is expected that some government bills will be simply dropped, to be reintroduced in the next Parliament if the Labour Party wins the General Election.
 The last Prime Minister's Question Time in the House of Commons is scheduled to be tomorrow, Wednesday April 6 at 11:00 UTC.
 After the election, the new Parliament is scheduled to be summoned on Wednesday May 11.  Its first business will be the election of the Speaker and the swearing-in of members.  The State Opening of Parliament is scheduled to then be on Tuesday May 17.
 The calling of the General Election marks the formal beginning of the general election campaigns by the U.K. political parties, although in practice all three major parties have been actively campaigining for several weeks.  The Conservative Party election slogan ""Are you thinking what we're thinking?"" was, for example, used by the party leader Michael Howard in his response to the Budget report on March 16, 2005 and was launched by the Scottish Conservatives on March 10.

"," Today at 10:30 BST (0930 UTC), the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom issued a ruling on the prorogation — a procedural suspension — of the Parliament of the United Kingdom until October 14. The court found that it could rule on the prorogation, and found the prorogation to be unlawful. The Supreme Court is the final court of appeal on all civil matters in the United Kingdom, as well as criminal matters in parts of the United Kingdom. The Supreme Court is lead by President Brenda Hale.
 The summary of the decision read in part: ""This Court has already concluded that the Prime Minister's advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect. This means that the Order in Council to which it led was also unlawful, void and of no effect and should be quashed. This means that when the Royal Commissioners walked into the House of Lords it was as if they walked in with a blank sheet of paper. The prorogation was also void and of no effect. Parliament has not been prorogued. This is the unanimous judgment of all 11 Justices.""
 Queen Elizabeth II suspended parliament at the behest of Boris Johnson, the current prime minister, on September 10. He is widely suspected of asking for prorogation to prevent legislative interference in his efforts to complete the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (EU), known as Brexit for British exit. Following that reasoning, the Court of Session in Scotland ruled on September 11 the prorogation was unlawful. The Supreme Court ruled on the appeal of that decision by Johnson's government.
 The High Court of England and Wales also ruled on the same day as the Scottish court, finding that the prorogation of Parliament was not a matter for the courts: ""In our view,  the decision  of  the  Prime  Minister to advise Her Majesty the Queen to prorogue Parliament is not justiciable in Her Majesty’s courts.""
 For three days last week, the court heard arguments from the two sides. Former prime minister John Major has accused Johnson of misleading the Queen, and argued that the true intent of seeking prorogation was to shut down debate in parliament, as the Court of Session found. The government's counter-argument was that prorogation is a political tool given by the legislature to the executive branch. If Parliament does not like prorogation or how it is used, it has the power to change the law. It is not for the Court to opine about the motivations, argued the government's lawyer, Richard Keen.
 Britons voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the EU. After failed negotiations for a deal on trade and deadline extension the deadline currently stands at October 31, 2019. Johnson has repeatedly stated that Britain must leave by that date with or without a deal. On September 13 — two days after the Court of Session ruling — he said he remained ""cautiously optimistic"" a deal would be reached.

 Tensions in the country increased dramatically, late August when it was reported between 100 and 1,300 people were killed in an alleged chemical attack. Many of those killed appeared to be children, with some of the pictures and video coming out of the country showing — according to witnesses — those who died from apparent suffocation; some foaming at the mouth, others having convulsions.
 Amongst Syria's few remaining allies, Iran, China, and Russia continue to oppose calls for military intervention. In an effort to provide a better-understanding of the reasoning behind their ongoing support, the following people were posed a range of questions.
 Iran, China, and Russia have remained as allies to the al-Assad government despite the alleged use of chemical weapons in Ghouta on August 21, 2013. Wikinews queried the listed subject-matter experts regarding the diplomatic relations between these nations, and the reasoning behind such.
 ((Wikinews))  There are suggestions China wants to maintain its financial ties with Syria as its third largest importer in 2010. Would you agree with this?
 ((WN))  Do you think China is talking from experience when it says that foreign countries shouldn't get involved with Syria's internal affairs? ((WN))  China abstained from a UN Security Council resolution on Libya — do you think they are trying to reprise what happened in Libya in terms of regime change?
 ((WN))  Do you think a political solution is the only realistic means to resolve the Syrian issue?
 ((Wikinews))  For many years, Syria has been considered Iran's ""closest ally"". What vested interest does the Iranian government have in keeping Bashar al-Assad in power? 
 ((Wikinews))  Do you think Iranian support for the Syrian government is a way of standing up against UN sanctions imposed on them, and opposing American imperialism?
 ((Wikinews))  The UN has ""overwhelmingly"" confirmed use of chemical weapons in Syria. Do you think both sides have used chemical weapons?
 ((Wikinews))  Would you agree that part of Iran's vested interest in Syria remaining under al-Assad is bound to two factors: religion and strategy?
 ((Wikinews))   Iran is home to the world's most populous Shiite Muslim nation. The Syrian rebels are Sunni. Could this be a Sunni vs. Shiite alignment in the Middle East? 
 ((Wikinews))  Russia is one of Syria's biggest arms suppliers. Do you think this means Russia's interest lies in economic benefit, as opposed to the humanitarian crisis?
 ((WN))  Do you believe Russia distrusts US intentions in the region — in the sense of countering the West on regime change?
 ((WN))  The Russian Government accepts that chemical weapons have been used in Syria. How does it come to claim that the rebels are behind the attacks even though it is widely accepted that the al-Assad government has stocks of weapons?
 ((WN))  Would you agree that Russia's vested interest in Syria remaining under al-Assad is bound to two factors: economics and ideology?

Chaos broke out in the Ukrainian parliament as several smoke bombs were thrown during a debate about the extended lease on a Russian naval base in Ukraine. Members of parliament (MPs) were seen fighting on the chamber floor while opposition MPs threw eggs at the speaker of the house, Volodymyr Lytvyn.
 It is not clear who threw the smoke bombs, although opposition MPs were thought to be responsible, but the debate continued despite the lingering smoke and chaos. The speaker had to be protected by two aides holding umbrellas and politicians held handkerchiefs to their mouths. 
 Along with the brawling MPs, thousands of people waited outside the parliament building protesting the extended lease. 
 The clashes began as members of parliament were debating extending the lease on the Sevastopol naval base. The Russians currently have a lease on the base until 2017. The Russians have offered Ukraine cheaper supplies of Russian natural gas in exchange for a further 25 years on the lease. 
 After the chaos had calmed down, MPs voted on the agreement and the deal extending the lease was backed 236 to 214. The deal was then put forward in the Russian lower house of parliament, where all 410 Russian MPs voted in favour of the deal.

 The bill calls for a return of the regions to Ukrainian control by military force if necessary. There is no mention of the February 2015 Minsk agreement which was signed by the Ukrainian government and rebel groups, and brokered by France and Germany.
 Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko stated on Twitter, ""We will continue to pave the way for reintegration of the occupied Ukrainian lands through political and diplomatic steps."" ((ukr))Ukrainian language: ‍Ми продовжуватимемо прокладати шлях для реінтеграції окупованих українських земель політико-дипломатичним шляхом. Former Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said this forms a legal basis for a United Nations peacekeeping force to ""remove the Russian army from Ukrainian territory"". Legislator Ivan Vinnyk commented on why the Minsk agreement was not mentioned in the bill: ""We can't embed diplomatic and political agreements that are prone to change into the Ukrainian legislation"".
 Russia's foreign ministry quickly denounced the law and claimed it was proof Ukraine is preparing for a new war. Furthermore, the law ""risked a dangerous escalation in Ukraine with unpredictable consequences for world peace and security"", the official statement said.
 ""Kiev has gone from sabotaging the Minsk agreements to burying them,"" said Konstantin Kosachev, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee for the Federation Council in Russia. Alexander Zakharchenko, leader of one of the rebel groups in eastern Ukraine, also expressed sharp criticism. Zakharchenko said it was a violation of the Minsk agreement and could lead to an escalation of the armed conflict.
 Fighting in eastern Ukraine began shortly after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has by reports claimed over 10,000 lives. About 1.7 million people, Al Jazeera reports, have been displaced from their homes due to the fighting.

"," The United States' House of Representatives backed a US$106 billion dollar (€75 billion) war bill today. The Senate will take a look at the bill next. The bill would fund the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The final vote was 226-202 in favor of the bill. The bill will also give authorization for $108 billion for credit lines for the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
 The bill will help to move President Barack Obama's plans to the next stage — namely reducing operations in Iraq and expanding in Afghanistan
 The bill was tough to pass, with only five Republicans supporting it and thirty-two Democrats voting against.  The lack of Republican support was due to the introduction of measures to provide $108 billion of new credit lines to the IMF, which they argue should have been part of a separate bill.
 The bill also included compromises with regards to Guantanamo Bay, allowing suspects to be taken to the United States for questioning but not for permanent detention.

"," On Thursday, Congress turned down the ""Net Neutrality Amendment"" to the Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Enhancement Act (COPE Act) 269-152. 
 The COPE Act is designed to make it easier for telecommunications companies to offer cable TV service and strengthen competition. Proponents hope it would lower the price of high-speed Internet for consumer by enabling Internet service providers to bundle phone, data, video and mobile phone services. The act is the first major telecommunications bill to come before Congress in over a decade, and it passed by 321-101 vote on Thursday.
 Portions of the ""Net Neutrality"" amendment to the COPE Act sought to assure that communication companies who provide Internet services treated all data delivery passing through their connections equally.  It specified that each broadband provider has the duty ""not to block, impair, degrade, discriminate against, or interfere with the ability of any person to use a broadband connection to access, use, send, receive, or offer lawful content, applications, or services over the Internet."" The amendment's passage would have prevented AT&T, Verizon, Comcast and other broadband providers from charging content providers like Google, Yahoo, Amazon or eBay for priority access to their networks. Democrats were largely in favour of the legislation with 140 Ayes and 58 Noes, whereas only 11 Republicans voted for the measure, with 211 against.
 House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi argued that ""The imposition of additional fees for Internet content providers would unduly burden Web-based small businesses and start-ups,"" and that ""They would also hamper communications by noncommercial users, those using religious speech, promoting civic involvement and exercising First Amendment freedoms.""
 The phone companies and their Congressional allies argued that the restrictions in the amendment would discourage investment in upgrading networks. Chief technology officer for BellSouth William L. Smith told the Washington Post that telephone companies should be able to charge companies for having their content load faster than that of competitors. ""If I go to the airport, I can buy a coach standby ticket or a first-class ticket,"" Smith said. ""In the shipping business, I can get two-day air or six-day ground.""
 The legislation has been subject to intense lobbying by telecommunication companies on one side, and content providers on the other. The bill is due to be discussed next in the Senate, where lobbying efforts from both sides are expected to intensify. The White House said that it supports the current bill.

"," The United States Congress, consisting of the House of Representatives and Senate, convened at 12:00 PM EST Thursday at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. for the first session of the 113th United States Congress. Newly elected and re-elected members of both the House of Representatives and Senate were sworn-in as both houses debated the rules and procedures to be adhered to for the next two years.
 The House of Representatives customarily elected its Speaker for the 113th Congress. Incumbent Speaker Republican John Boehner was re-elected, defeating Democrat Nancy Pelosi by a vote of 220–192. Boehner's re-election as House Speaker ended speculation that the Republican Party would split and nominate another candidate to challenge him for the gavel following internal tumult during the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations last month. After Boehner was sworn-in for his second term as Speaker, he proceeded to swear-in all 435 elected and re-elected members of the House en masse.
 Members of the United States Senate were sworn-in in groups of four by Vice President and President of the Senate Joe Biden. Among the membership of the U.S. Senate for the 113th Congress are a record-setting 20 female Senators, including newly-elected Democrat Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate.
 Members of the Senate and House of Representatives joined Joe Biden and John Boehner, respectively, after the formal swearing-in ceremony for re-enactment ceremonies in front of photographers.
 Republican Mark Kirk, United States Senator from Illinois, also officially returned to his duties after suffering a debilitating stroke last January 21st that forced him to learn how to walk again. Fulfilling a goal he had set for himself after his stroke, Kirk ascended the 45 steps leading up to the Senate wing of the United States Capitol building with assistance from both Joe Biden and fellow Senator Joe Manchin, as several other members of both houses of Congress and well-wishers looked on. He is expected to continue rehabilitation, while convenient housing arrangements have been made.
 In the new congress, there are 53 Democrats, 45 Republicans and two independents in the Senate. The House of Representatives now has 234 Republicans and 201 Democrats in its membership. Having convened, the 113th Congress is expected to face issues including the debt ceiling, taxes and the federal budget deficit.

"," As of 10:00 p.m EST November 8, 2006, the Democratic Party is projected to have gained control of both the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate in the 2006 United States general elections. MSNBC projects that the Democrats now control 234 seats in the House of Representatives, 16 more seats than the 218 needed to control the House of Representatives as all 435 seats were up for election. In the Senate, where the balance of power is closer, one-third of all seats were up for grab. As of 10:00 p.m. EST, AP and Reuters were projecting that the Democrats had picked up all six seats they needed to retake the Senate, including the seats of incumbents Rick Santorum (Penn.), Lincoln Chafee (R.I.), Jim Talent (Missouri), Mike DeWine (Ohio), John Tester (Montana), and Jim Webb (VA). The Tester victory by less than 3,000 votes was projected at approximately 2 p.m. EST after the State of Montana announced the results of overnight recounts. Democrat Jim Webb has prevailed in that race by slightly more than 7,000 votes, though his opponent has not conceded and a recount may still occur.
 Although the Bush Administration's policy on Iraq was seen as a major issue by voters, exit polls indicated that corruption was of greater concern. Republicans found themselves plagued by a series of scandals in recent months, ranging from the Jack Abramoff corruption scandal to revelations about sexual improprieties involving well-known Republicans, including Congressman Mark Foley and White House confidant Ted Haggard. Many conservative evangelical Christians, the GOP's most reliable voting block, have become disappointed by the scandals and may not vote in great numbers. Pat Buchanan, whose campaigns have often appealed to that voting block, told ABC News, ""There's the spending orgy, the arrogance of power . . . . The war in Iraq, failure to protect our border, hurting the working class in Ohio, for example, the list goes on and on. We're more dissatisfied with the Republican Party than we've ever been.""
 Voter turnout was also influenced by a number of initiatives on state ballots. Michigan's Proposal 2 would outlaw affirmative action in virtually all government programs. Oklahoma voters were slated to decide if stores could sell alcohol on election days. In South Dakota, voters were asked if the state should make marijuana use legal for therapeutic purposes. Many states included initiatives related to eminent domain powers, same-sex marriage, and taxes. In California, voters faced a whopping 36 initiatives. Voters energized by initiatives were more likely to show up at the polls, and more likely to vote for candidates from their party.
 Several races turned nasty in the closing days of the campaign, with candidates from both parties turning up the heat on their opponents and accusing their rivals of dirty tricks. MSNBC reported that the FBI was investigating calls made to voters in Virginia in an apparent attempt to intimidate and confuse voters. This follows a similar investigation in California, where staff in Republican Congressional candidate Tan D. Nguyen's campaign office sent letters to Latino voters telling them that ""You are advised that if your residence in this country is illegal or you are an immigrant, voting in a federal election is a crime that could result in jail time."" Naturalized citizens are allowed to vote in elections.
 Candidates in both New York and Michigan reported that automated telephone calls had been made to voters in the dead of night, purporting to be from their campaigns. The candidates said their campaigns had nothing to do with the calls, and had been made fraudulently in an attempt to make voters angry at them. 
 It was unclear whether these calls were related to other calls, financed by the National Republican Congressional Committee, that had been made to voters in several states in the previous week. Those calls had generated complaints by voters from both parties who said they were repeated several times in the same day. In at least one state, the calls were pulled when the attorney general notified the NRCC that the calls violated state law.
 A different kind of ""robocall"" was reported in Iowa, where three Democratic candidates for the state House reported that they had been the target of anonymous attack ad calls. The calls inaccurately claimed that the candidates support free health care and college tuition for illegal aliens.
 The New Jersey Attorney General's office sent deputies to polling places after Republicans reported possible fraud. The deputies reportedly found no problems.
 The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund photographed armed men attempting to prevent Hispanic voters from entering polling places in Tucson. The photographs and reports of the incidents were sent to the FBI.
 Problems with voting devices, both electronic and manual, required some polling places to remain open later than scheduled. Electronic devices were being used for the first time in about a third of the states.
 Air America Radio reported that electronic voting machines in Delaware County, Indiana and Cleveland, Ohio malfunctioned, frustrating voters and election workers. A report published on the USA Today website said election workers in some parts of Florida had resorted to using paper ballots when their electronic voting machines failed to work. National Public Radio reported that some electronic voting machines in Texas had to be turned off when they improperly gave votes to candidates not selected by voters. Problems were also reported in Maine, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.
 A voting problem of a different type was reported in Kentucky. A Louisville poll worker is alleged to have physically assaulted a voter. Jefferson County clerk spokesperson Paula McCraney said that the voter wanted to press charges after being allegedly choked and pushed by the election worker. No information was available on what led to the incident.

"," Tuesday, World Bank released the 2012 World Development Report on Gender Equality and Development.  The United States is referred to many times, often as a benchmark to foster understanding of recent gains for women in other parts of the globe. At the same time, United States women still lag behind US men in a number of areas.
 In 2012, the authors note women in the United States still face challenges economically and socially.  They are represented disproportionately in certain professions like teaching and nursing.  They are paid less than their male counterparts. Jobs traditionally held by women also result in lower wages for men who hold these jobs.     They are under-represented at the highest level of business, with only 28 of Fortune 1000 companies having a female chief executive officer.  The bottom 20% of women economically have a slightly higher birth rate than their peers in the top 20%. 
 Immigrants to the United States from Southeast Asia and India have higher than expected male to female birth ratios, which the report authors suggest is partially deliberate sex selection based on cultural attitudes from home countries.  In 2009, over half a million US women were victims of intimate partner violence.  The report suggests US men have greater pension assets than US women. When compared to elderly US men, elderly women in the United States are more likely to live alone than with a spouse.  US women are disproportionately under-represented in local police forces, accounting for less than 20% of all police officers.  Women in the United States also bear a higher percentage of housework duties than men at 61%.  When US women take part time work while raising children, they find it difficult to use that work experience to gain future full time employment.  US women are disincentivized from re-entering the workforce after giving birth because of the high cost of childcare.
 Many of the gains for United States women took place a while ago and took a long time to get.  It took 40 years, 1870–1910, to see major improvements in the percentage of girls aged 6 to 12 attending school. In 1921, after women got the right to vote in the United States, the United States Congress passed the Promotion of the Welfare and Hygiene of Maternity and Infancy Act. This assisted in lowering infant mortality from 23% to 15%.  
 The report says affirmative action in the United States resulted in jobs transferring from men to women, but the authors hedged and did not draw a conclusion about the economic impact of these legislative efforts other than to say the impact was not negative. 
 Many of the legislative victories for United States women came early compared to developing countries. Property rights for women, while later than some of their European counterparts like Norway and the United Kingdom, started to come by 1848.  That year, the Married Women’s Property Act was passed in New York.  It was the first legislation of its kind in the country.  Other states soon followed. Women got suffrage on a state-by-state level in the country until they got federal suffrage in 1920.  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 barred discrimination against women and allowed married women to make loans without their husband's consent. In 1980, airlines were barred from discriminating against flight attendances for their marital status during the hiring and firing stage.
 The number of United States respondents agreeing with the proposition ""a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl"" decreased from about 14% in the period between 1994 and 1999 to about about 9% in the period between 2005 and 2007.  Similarly, the number of people who agreed with ""when jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women"" decreased from 19% to about 8% over the same period.
 The report cites current research from the United States and England showing the more education a mother has, the better the outcomes for her children will be.
 Currently in the United States, females academically outperform their male counterparts in all academic areas including [[mathematics|math] and science. On the Programme for International Student Assessment math test though, US boys tested better than US girls by a score of roughly 495 to 480.  US girls outperform boys on the literacy test with mean scores of approximately 510 to 490.  In this regard, the report suggests US girls' performance patterns resemble global ones. 
 Mali's percentage of girls in primary school is equivalent to the United States in 1810 at around 34%. Burkino Faso is worse, matching the United States in 1780 with a percentage of roughly 25%. Niger's current enrollment for girls is around 50%, around the same percentage as the United States in 1900.

Republicans against the bill argued that it was an entitlement program for New Yorkers and that it was another example of bloated government. ""There is no excuse for this kind of legislation,"" argued Texan Republican representative Lamar Smith.
 The Republicans offered an alternative that would reduce funding for 9/11 workers and pay for the remainder by cutting parts of a major health care bill passed earlier this year. This measure failed 185–244.

Airlines with plans include Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, Bahrain-based Gulf Air, Kuwait-based Al Jazeera Airways, Dubai-based Emirates Airlines, and United Kingdom-based British Airways.
 US President Barack Obama delayed a decision on potential US military action against Syria until after September 9, when the US Congress returns from recess.
 In an e-mail to Arabian Business, an Etihad Airways spokesperson said, ""The safety and security of our customers is absolutely paramount and we have drawn up robust flight re-routing contingency plans in the event of any airspace being closed to commercial aircraft. [...] Our 24 hours Network Operations Centre is constantly in communication with all air space management organisations in which we operate.""
 A British Airways spokesperson is quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald saying, ""We are keeping our operations under review and we would make any changes that would be necessary"".
 Gulf Air said in an e-mail to Arabian Business, ""Nonetheless, given the current political climate, the airline has fully prepared contingency plans in case of any military intervention in the coming days [...] These contingency plans are ready for implementation should there be any changes in the current situation in Syria. Such plans could potentially involve re-routing aircraft away from Syrian/neighbouring airspace. At the moment operations continue as normal and we are ready for all eventualities."" Gulf Air says it currently has no flights passing over Syrian airspace.
 Several airlines have already suspended commercial services into Syria, including Etihad who did so a year ago.  Al Jazeera suspended their services during the final quarter of 2012. Last week, Cyprus Airways rescheduled their flights into Beirut because of the potential conflict. Several airlines have had to deal with similar situations in the past few years as a result of events connected to the Arab Spring that closed parts of Middle East airspace and airports.

Miller was challenging the state election authorities over their decision to allow misspelled write-in ballots in support of his opponent, Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski—the incumbent Republican senator for Alaska—lost a primary challenge to Miller and thus had to stand as a write-in candidate.

"," The USA Freedom Act, introduced in to the US House of Representatives as HR 3361 and to the US Senate as S. 1599, on Thursday passed out of House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and on to the House floor. Foreign Policy reported the bill was ""the most aggressive NSA reform bill under consideration in Congress"", however, after amendment, the bill has been questioned for extending the Patriot Act and the reduction of reform to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
 The USA Freedom Act had the stated goal of ending the bulk collection of Americans' metadata, ending the secret laws created by the FISA court, and introducing a ""Special Advocate"" to represent public and privacy matters before the FISA court.
 In May 2014, the US House Judiciary Committee posted a ""Manager's Amendment"" on its website. Title VII of the Amendment read ""Section 102(b)(1) of the USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 (50 U.S.C. 1805 note) is amended by striking 'June 1, 2015' and inserting 'December 31, 2017'"", extending the USA PATRIOT Act through the end of 2017. A number of organizations have taken stances against the Patriot Act, for example, the American Library Association became so concerned it urged its members to defend free speech and protect patrons' privacy against the Act.
 
According to Deputy Attorney General James Cole, even if the Freedom Act becomes law, the NSA could continue its bulk collection of American's phone records. He explained that ""it's going to depend on how the [FISA] court interprets any number of the provisions"" contained within the legislation. Jennifer Granick, Director of Civil Liberties at Stanford Law School, stated:  Cynthia Wong of Human Rights Watch (HRW) expressed concern that ""the bill does not address needed reforms to surveillance programs that affect millions of people outside US borders.” This being a key problem that plagues US surveillance activities according to HRW.
 Mike Rogers, a defender of the NSA's surveillance practices and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called the proposed amendments a ""huge improvement"". On the other hand, USA Freedom Act co-author and Senate Committee on the Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy commented that he ""remain concerned that the legislation approved today does not include some of the important reforms related to national security letters, a strong special advocate at the FISA Court, and greater transparency. I will continue to push for those reforms when the Senate Judiciary Committee considers the USA FREEDOM Act this summer.""

"," People in American Samoa were given only eight minutes warning that a tsunami, which killed 32 people in the unincorporated territory, resulting from the 2009 Samoa earthquake, was approaching. A report published by the United States Congress admits that the warning was issued sixteen minutes after the 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck Samoa. The tsunami killed nearly 200 people in American Samoa, Samoa and Tonga. 
 The report, written by the National Research Council, describes the length of time between the earthquake and the initial tsunami warning being issued as ""relatively long"", and states that the standard time for such a warning to be issued to be around two minutes. The study also revealed that one third of tsunami sensors are not working at any given time.
 John Orcutt, a [seismologist and head of the committee that wrote the report, described the delay as a ""major concern"", but he also said that ""a large number of people"" in American Samoa ""didn't understand and there were lives that were lost because people simply didn't take the action to get away from the shore when they felt this huge earthquake. People have to understand the signs of a tsunami and head to higher ground."" 
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency, whose purpose is to coordinate the response to a disaster that has occurred in the United States and that overwhelms the resources of local and state authorities, and the Government of American Samoa did not respond to e-mails regarding the news.
 The study also notes that people living in other coastal cities around the world are at risk of being unprepared for tsunamis that arrive soon after the earthquake occurs, stating that in many places, warnings might not be issued in time. ""If the source were so close to shore that only minutes were available before the tsunami reached the coast, the public would need to recognize natural [signs of a tsunami approaching]."" The report states that when they fear a tsunami is imminent, people should know to evacuate even ""without official warnings.""
 The report warns that because tsunamis are so rare, people living near the coast do not know what to do, but it also criticises authorities for not informing citizens of how to react when a tsunami is approaching. ""Everybody thought that the tsunami was a single wave, and once the expected landfall time came and left, they thought it was over,"" said Costas Synolakis, who is director of the 
Tsunami Research Center at the University of Southern California, and one of the report's authors. He continued, ""In fact, tsunamis are a series of waves that can last for three to four hours."" 
 He said that the United States must take action, training first responders in low-lying coastal areas, and adding more tsunami sensors to give advance warning of approaching waves. Synolakis added that, after receiving warning that there may have been a tsunami on the way after the Chile earthquake earlier this year, the response of firefighters at the Port of Los Angeles was poor because they were unfamiliar with how to deal with such a threat.
 In the capital of American Samoa, Pago Pago, the tsunami measured 1.57 meters in height. The superintendent of the National Park of American Samoa Mike Reynolds reported four waves as high as six meters. People who experienced the quake said it was long, lasting from 90 seconds to three minutes. ""Pago Pago city streets were strewn with overturned vehicles, cars, and debris. Some buildings located only slightly above sea level were completely destroyed by the waves, and power in some locations is not expected to be restored for up to a month,"" Wikinews reported at the time. 
 Didi Afuafi, 28, who was riding on a bus in American Samoa when the tsunami struck, described her experiences. ""I was scared. I was shocked. All the people on the bus were screaming, crying and trying to call their homes. We couldn't get on cell phones. The phones just died on us. It was just crazy,"" she said. ""This is going to be talked about for generations."" U.S. President Barack Obama said of the disaster: ""My deepest sympathies are with the families who lost loved ones and many people who have been affected by the earthquake and the tsunami.""
 The people of American Samoa will, next Wednesday, according to a press release by the government, ""hold island-wide services to honor the memories of the 34 loved ones who lost their lives"" during the tsunami. Church services will be held at 6:00 a.m., followed at 6:48 a.m.—the time when the earthquake occured—thirty-two bells will be rung in memory of those who perished.

"," Apple Inc.'s iPhone and iPad periodically send location information back to the company, according to new reports. The data is transmitted to a secure database that only it can access, Apple claims.
 Bruce Sewell, an attorney for Apple, sent a letter to two US Representatives last year, discussing the company's data collection techniques and policies. The thirteen-page letter states that location information is recorded and sent to Apple every twelve hours, but only if the user enables the device's location settings.
 Apple began building a location database of its own when it decided to stop using similar services offered by Google & SkyHook Wireless. Location data is used in social networking applications and call routing.
 In a statement to the Associated Press,  Democratic Massachusetts Representative Edward Markey said, ""Apple needs to safeguard the personal location information of its users to ensure that an iPhone doesn't become an iTrack.""
 Such data collection is not unique to Apple. Google's Android operating system uses similar technology to provide location-based services to its users. Google has said that it also uses the data collected to provide accurate traffic data through its ""Maps"" applications on both Apple and Android devices. However, the company declined to comment on the latest findings regarding its data collection.
 Apple was also recently in the spotlight after it was discovered that the iPhone and iPad were retaining location data on the device itself. This information is collected in an unencrypted file and is not transmitted elsewhere. The data file reportedly contains a variety of information, including longitude and latitude, cell phone tower identification data, wireless hotspot identification, and timestamps.

"," On Tuesday, the United States Democratic Party held primary elections in the states of Arizona, Florida, and Illinois. By reports, former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden won all three elections. Ohio, which was also scheduled to hold a primary election, delayed its voting in the face of the national emergency around the spread of the COVID-19 disease. The same day, incumbent President of the United States Donald Trump became the Republican Party's presumptive nominee for the 2020 United States presidential election after winning the party's primaries in Florida and Illinois.
 The Democratic and Republican Parties use primary elections, along with caucuses, to select their nominees for the 2020 presidential election. For a candidate to win the Democratic Party's nomination, a total of at least 1,991 delegates are needed. The three primary elections the Democratic party held represented a total of 441 delegates.
 Biden's victories in Arizona, Florida, and Illinois left him with a reported total of 1,124 pledged delegates; United States Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders trailed him with a total of 815. In the 2016 United States presidential election, Sanders also lost in all three of these states to Hillary Clinton. The Democratic Party awards delegates proportionally to how candidates fare; candidates must receive at least 15% of the vote to be eligible to earn delegates from a state, territory, or district within a state or territory.
 On the Republican side, 1,276 delegates are required to secure the nomination. After winning the Republican Party's primaries in Florida and Illinois on Tuesday, Trump reportedly amassed 1,330 delegates, more than the number needed, making him the Republican Party's presumptive nominee.
 In Ohio, which was planning to hold its primary election on Tuesday, Governor Mike DeWine postponed it, citing the health crisis. In a two-part statement on Twitter, he wrote, ""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus."" He continued by announcing, ""As such, @DrAmyActon will order the polls closed as a health emergency. While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State @FrankLaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.""
 DeWine's decision comes a few days after President Trump declared a national emergency in response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak. The World Health Organization has classified the the outbreak of COVID-19 disease as a pandemic.
 As of Tuesday, Ohio was one of six states that had decided to postpone its election. Maryland rescheduled most of its primary races to June 2; they were originally planned for April 28. It did not change the date of its special election to fill the United States House of Representatives seat formerly held by Elijah Cummings, but instead is to switch to mail-in voting only. Cummings died in October at the age of 68.
 The Democratic National Committee urged states not to reschedule their elections but rather to use mail-in voting instead. Support for mail-in voting also came from United States Senator from Minnesota Amy Klobuchar. On Monday, Klobuchar, along with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, introduced a bill to require voting by mail in all states as an emergency measure. Klobuchar was herself a candidate in the 2020 presidential election before she ended her campaign.

"," An arrest warrant was issued on Wednesday for former U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. Bail was set at US$10,000 ahead of his scheduled court appearance in Austin, Texas for two separate charges of money laundering and conspiracy. 
 The warrant is being treated as a procedural formality of law, and court officials said DeLay was expected to go to Fort Bend County Jail in his district near Houston for booking, but this has not yet been confirmed. The warrant lists two felony charges, conspiracy and money laundering in a campaign finance scheme tied to his political action committee, Texans for a Republican Majority. Texas law forbids the use of corporate money in political campaigns. He is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Friday before state District Judge Bob Perkins.
 DeLay has denied any wrongdoing. He is accused of laundering $190,000 in corporate campaign contributions through the Republican National Committee for distribution to Republican candidates for the Texas Legislature in 2002. The money helped the Repbulicans to take control of the Texas Legislature, which then redistricted congressional voting boundaries. As a result this lead to an expanded majority of the house Republicans.
 In response to questions DeLay's lawyer Dick DeGuerin characterized the warrant as ""a matter of routine"" and assured that ""bond will be posted"". The warrant followed a series of grand jury indictments handed down in late September and early October and prompted DeLay to step down temporarily as house majority leader.

He said more information about his candidacy would be forthcoming next week, but he will run without party affiliation.
 This seat is currently held by Congressman Joe Knollenberg, a Republican who has been the incumbent since 1993. Democrat and former state senator Gary Peters is also contesting the seat.
 Kevorkian told The Oakland Press of Pontiac, which broke the story, that his campaign was in a ""formative stage"". In order to be on the ballot, Kevorkian will need to collect 3,000 signatures by the middle of July.
 ""That will be very easy for Jack,"" said Ruth Holmes, a long-standing associate of Kevorkian. ""Jack is in great spirits, and he intends to do this. He just hopes for some honesty in government,"" she said.
 Mike Brownfield, the campaign manager for Knollenberg said it ""doesn't affect Joe Knollenberg at all. He's going to keep getting things done for Oakland County's families.""

 Oakland County prosecutor Dave Gorcyca, whose office got Kevorkian convicted of second-degree homicide in 1999, said, ""To call attention to himself is standard protocol for Jack when he doesn't have the limelight focused on him. I would not consider his candidacy to be a legitimate one.""

"," In a 70 to 30 vote on Thursday, the United States Senate voted to confirm Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke for a second term.
 The vote, which was not split along party lines (11 Democrats and 19 Republicans voted against Bernanke), was the closest vote ever for a Federal Reserve chair appointment. The previous closest vote was in 1983, when Paul A. Volcker was confirmed by the Senate, 84 to 16. Complaints against Bernanke mostly involved his presiding over the major economic downturn, as well as the bailout of AIG. In the case of the latter, Bernanke agreed to the AIG matters being audited by the Government Accountability Office.
 The supporters of Bernanke included Democratic Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who said in support, ""Let us not judge the man or the work prematurely."" Conversely, Democrat Barbara Boxer of California questioned his commitment to all economic aspects, stating, ""The American people have the right to ask whether the Fed is truly committed to supporting Main Street's economy, not just Wall Street."" 
 Among the opposers included Republican Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky, the lone vote against Bernanke on his original appointment. He said, ""a vote for Ben Bernanke is a vote for bailouts."" Republican George Voinovich of Ohio voted in support for Bernanke, as did Utah SenatorOrrin Hatch.
 Bernanke was originally looking to pass easily, but opposition began rising in the Senate chambers after Ted Kennedy's seat was lost to the Republicans, though Obama began outreach to Democratic Senators after the election, putting the confirmation back on track.

 The bill in question was the result of a deal announced by Obama on Sunday. It was approved by the House of Representatives on Monday night 269–161, passed the Senate early Tuesday afternoon 74–26, and was subsequently signed by Obama.
 Under the terms of the bill, the debt limit can be raised from its previous level of US$14.3 trillion by $900 billion. An amount of $400 billion can be immediately authorized by the President, while the rest is still subject to Congressional approval. Along with the increase, there will be an immediate budget cut of $917 billion, with total savings of at least $2.1 trillion over the next decade.
 In the longer term, the bill allows the establishment of a special bipartisan committee of lawmakers from both the Senate and House to come up with proposals to reduce the federal budget deficit by at least another $1.5 trillion. Those proposals will be voted on no later than December 23, at which point the debt limit can be again increased, by up to $1.5 trillion if the committee's proposals are approved or by $1.2 trillion if they fail.

 ""We are in the midst of a serious financial crisis and the federal government is responding with decisive action,"" Bush said in his televised speech.
 Bush called for the United States Congress to pass a US$700 billion bill intended to keep struggling companies afloat. He asked the two presidential candidates along with leaders from both parties of Congress to join him for a conference on Thursday.
 Last Friday, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson called for a bailout plan that would allow for the United States government to purchase devalued mortgage backed securities, resulting from the subprime mortgage crisis, from troubled financial institutions. Paulson has said that the plan could cost up to $700 billion. Congressional leaders have said that some form of the plan will pass; however, there is considerable debate over several key issues.
 White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said that Bush ""believes it is important for the American people to fully understand the depth of the crisis in our financial markets, how that crisis affects them, and the urgent need to agree on a solution."" Bush has been criticized for waiting too long to speak in prime time. 
 John McCain suspended his campaign to return to Washington and work on the bailout bill. Barack Obama has called for another form of the bill to pass and said that Congress should not package the bailout bill with any other bills — such as an economic stimulus plan.
 Meanwhile, Congress has held a second round of hearings on the proposed bailout bill. Paulson and Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke testified in front of the House Financial Services Committee. They felt it was a serious problem in need of an immediate solution.
 Rep. Barney Frank, Chairman of House Financial Services Committee, says it is ""clear"" that the financial bailout bill will pass.
 Director of the Congressional Budget Office Peter R. Orsza said while testifying before Congress that ""ironically, the intervention could even trigger additional failures of large institutions, because some institutions may be carrying troubled assets on their books at inflated values.""
 The bailout plan has been called a ""blank check"" by many, with members of both parties divided on the issue.

 ""Today, I signed into law a bill that will allow federal courts to hear a claim by or on behalf of Terri Schiavo for violation of her rights relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food, fluids, or medical treatment necessary to sustain her life,"" said Bush's written statement.
 Bush waited at the White House for the bill's arrival and signed it into law after returning early from a vacation at his Texas ranch.
 The House passed the bill by a vote of 203–58 shortly after midnight in a rare Sunday session called at 9pm that night. Democrats objected to a call for unanimous consent earlier in the day. Although most members had left for the Easter break, 261 of the 435 House members returned for the vote.
 Representatives debated the measure in the House from both sides.
 Rep. James Sensenbrenner, a Wisconsin Republican, said of previous rulings in Florida that they were ""enforcing a merciless directive to deprive Terri Schiavo of her right to life."" He continued that the House should ""reinforce the law's commitment to justice and compassion for all Americans, particularly the most vulnerable.""
 Democrat Robert Wexler of Florida disagreed, saying ""Tonight this Congress is about to commit a travesty. Tonight congressional leaders are poised to appoint this Congress as a judge and a jury.""
 The US Senate had passed the bill by unanimous consent earlier in the day.
 Terri Schiavo has been on life-support for over 15 years, and is currently cared for at a Florida hospice. She is considered by physicians to be in a ""permanent vegetative state"", while her parents contend that she is viable and that there is hope for recovery. Schiavo's feeding tube was removed on Friday after Florida courts ruled in favor of her husband, Michael Schiavo, who acts as her legal guardian in the matter. Terri Schiavo's siblings, and her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, challenge this decision.

 Similar to the existing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, CAFTA would create a free trade zone putting an end to most trade barriers between the United States and six additional countries, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic.
 The free trade agreement faces stiff opposition among Democrats. Many Republicans who represent agricultural Corn Belt or industrial Rust Belt and southern textile states in Congress also have stated opposition to the bill. But with a Republican majority in the House large enough to ensure passage of CAFTA, party leaders are trying to shore up enough votes to ensure CAFTA's passage.
 This has prompted last minute action by the President to lobby individual members of the House, reminding them that Central American countries have committed troops and other resources to fight the U.S. War on Terror. Other Republican leaders have been using the party's traditional pro-business message and linking it to homeland security issues.
 ""Trade creates jobs and lifts people out of poverty and there's nothing like a stable society to fight terrorism and strengthen democracy, freedom and rule of law,"" Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the House, reportedly said at a news conference Tuesday.

Her views are common among Democrats, who are overwhelmingly against the treaty.

He also accused Comey of ""showboating"" and said ""the FBI has been in turmoil.""
 James Comey was leading an investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia and possible Russian involvement in the 2016 US presidential election that placed Trump in power.  The official reason given for his dismissal, overly harsh treatment of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, was met with skepticism from politicians and the press.
 President Trump also told NBC's Lester Holt that, despite statements to the contrary by Vice President Pence and Sean Spicer, recommendations from deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein did not have anything to do with his decision, which he made before receiving Rosenstein's memo. ""Regardless of recommendation I was going to fire Comey. Knowing, there was no good time to do it[...] And, in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself, I said: 'You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story, it's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should've won.'"" He went on to express regret that firing Comey might prolong the investigation and said Comey had told him that he, Trump, was not under investigation when asked.
 Trump told NBC that he had asked Comey if he, Trump, were under investigation, to which Comey had replied in the negative.  While it is not illegal under U.S. law for President Trump to ask if he is under investigation, former U.S. Department of Justice spokesperson Matthew Miller described it as ""completely inappropriate"" and pointed out that Comey would not be allowed to answer under Department rules.
 Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders disagreed with Miller's assessment. ""I don't see it as a conflict of interest and neither do many of the legal scholars who've been commenting on it over the last hour."" She did not elaborate on the reference to legal scholars.
 While some sources have said Comey requested more resources for the Russia investigation only days before being fired, one of his associates told news outlets this was not true and the investigation had no shortage of resources.
 In his interview with Holt, President Trump affirmed that his campaign had no connections to Russia.
 Four candidates for Comey's position were scheduled to be interviewed today: a lawyer named Alice Fisher, an appeals court judge named Michael Garcia, Senator John Cornyn of Texas, and Andrew McCabe, who is currently serving as acting director of the FBI. McCabe has promised to ""vigorously and completely"" continue the Russia investigation and to tell Congress if any pressure is brought to bear to stop it.

"," The United States Congress has launched its own inquiry into a decision by the U.S spy agency to destroy tapes of interrogations of terror suspects, with Central Intelligence Agency chief Michael Hayden testifying before lawmakers this week.
 The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,  Democrat Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, says Hayden will appear before his panel.
 ""CIA director Michael Hayden is going appear before our committee on this coming Tuesday and talk about interrogation and techniques,"" said Rockefeller. 
 During an appearance on the CBS television program Face the Nation, Rockefeller made clear members have a lot of questions about the destroyed videotapes.
 ""Were there things on those tapes that they did not want to have seen, that did not conform to what the attorney general would allow them to do?"" he said.
 Rockefeller indicated the session will take place behind closed doors, to enable law makers to delve into areas that are still considered top secret, and have to do with specific interrogation procedures.
 The CIA director disclosed the destroyed videotapes last Thursday, after he got word that their existence had been uncovered by the news media.  The tapes which were made in 2002, showed the interrogation of top terror suspects. They were destroyed in 2005, and Congressional critics charge that could amount to tampering with legal evidence and obstruction of justice.
 Democrat Joe Biden of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and former chair of the Judiciary panel, says the preliminary joint inquiry by the Justice Department and the CIA announced yesterday is not enough.
 Biden, who is running for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, was interviewed on ABC's This Week.
 ""I think that Hayden is not to be the judge of whether or not his condoning the destroying of the tapes was lawful. It appears as though there may be an obstruction of justice charge here, tampering with evidence, destroying evidence,and I think this is one case where it really does call for a special counsel,"" said Biden.
 Hayden told CIA employees Thursday the tapes were destroyed out of fears that if they ever became public, the identities of the interrogators would be revealed and their lives would be in danger.
 President Bush gave the intelligence community the go-ahead to use enhanced interrogation techniques on terror suspects following the September 11th 2001, attacks on the United States.
 The Bush administration has refused to specify which methods are permitted, but critics charge some amount to torture, including a procedure known as waterboarding, which simulates drowning.
 Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona has called for the White House to publicly disavow the use of harsh interrogation techniques.

 ""What this does in a larger sense is it harms the credibility and the moral standing of America in the world again,"" said McCain. ""There will be skepticism and cynicism all over the world about how we treat prisoners and whether we practice torture or not.""
 Senator McCain, a former Vietnam War era prisoner of war, has been one of the most outspoken members of Congress on the treatment of detainees in the war on terror. He is campaigning to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee.

 The director of Franken's Midwest Values Political Action Committee has refused to comment on the reports, and Franken has made no official announcement himself.
 Earlier this week, Franken announced on his Air America Radio show that he will no longer be hosting the show, but also said that he would make a decision about the senate race in the near future.

"," Wikinews contributors have discovered that members of the United States Congress or members of their staff have recently been making questionable edits to Wikipedia, the free online encyclopedia anyone can edit. This continues the trend identified by four exclusive Wikinews reports over a four-year period exposing questionable and fraudulent edits made beginning in 2005 by Congress members or staff.
 Beginning in 2006, Wikinews reported that members of Congress or their staff were vandalizing Wikipedia by removing critical information in various articles, or adding false or offensive information. These edits were and continue to be done using computers owned or operated by the United States government.
 In this new investigation, Wikinews has found that at least two of the three major Internet Protocol Addresses (IP) attached to computers used by members of the U.S. House of Representatives and their staff have been the source of Wikipedia edits for several years. As recently as April 2009 they have been adding or removing false and/or offensive information from articles related to political figures or members of Congress.
 Although the IP addresses belong exclusively to the U.S Congress as a whole, they are linked to many different computers throughout the U.S. which are used by many different House representatives or their staff members. In response to an edit, another Wikipedia contributor posts a message on the user discussion page for the IP address, advising anyone that may view the page that the address belongs to Congress.
 In January, one individual using a Congressional computer removed a source in an article. Five minutes later, using the same congressional IP address, someone replaced the source with an apology saying, ""sorry--House of Reps IPs should not be editing [Wikipedia], even other office's pages on lunch break."" Despite the advisories, Wikinews has found that the individuals continued to make vandal-like edits to the encyclopedia.
 In one instance, Wikinews found that someone with one of the IP addresses, 143.231.249.141, began to edit the Wikipedia article for Steve Austria, the Republican representative for Ohio's 7th congressional district. The individual began to edit on March 18, 2009 at 23:32 UTC. He or she used the official House of Representatives gateway to remove a section of information relating to inaccurate comments Austria made about The Great Depression. Austria stated in an interview with The Columbus Dispatch in February that Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal in 1933 caused the U.S. to go into a depression.
 ""When Roosevelt did this, he put our country into a Great Depression. ... He tried to borrow and spend, he tried to use the Keynesian approach, and our country ended up in a Great Depression. That's just history,"" said Austria during the February 11 interview. He later admitted that his statement was wrong, saying Roosevelt's spending ""did not have the desired effect,"" which caused the depression. Exactly two minutes later on March 18, the same IP address removed information relating to bloggers accusing Austria of plagiarism in 2008. They accused him of taking credit for a column that was published in his name in the Xenia Gazette on September 2, 2008. Bloggers had discovered that the column was a direct copy of a report on the history of Labor Day originally published by the U.S. Department of Labor. The edits were reverted, the last being over four hours after the information was removed. Despite some constructive edits, such as correcting the spelling of Wisconsin congressman Steve Kagen's name and correcting grammatical errors, the same IP removed the information in both sections a total of six times from March 18 to April 24, 2009.
 After seeing the suspicious edits, Wikinews examined the edit history for Austria's article to see if any other suspicious edits were made. After a brief search, Wikinews discovered that the IP address 65.189.244.162 removed the same information just 15 days earlier on March 3, being the first address to remove the information. Only one edit has been made to Wikipedia from that IP address so far. After tracing the address, Wikinews discovered the person who made the edits lives in or near Fairborn, which is located 8.5 miles from Beavercreek, where Austria currently resides. Austria also grew up in Xenia which is located just 12 miles from Fairborn and only 8 miles from Beavercreek. 
 Another individual, with the IP address 75.187.63.132, also removed the allegations of plagiarism from Austria's article in February. The individual removed what they called ""Politically Motivated BS [bullshit]"" from the article of Deborah Pryce, former congresswoman for Ohio's 15th congressional district. The information was related to fundraisers between 2001 and 2004 that were held at restaurants belonging to convicted felon and former lobbyist Jack Abramoff. After tracing the IP address, Wikinews found that the edit was made from a computer located in Columbus, Ohio, the location of Pryce's offices and one of the cities in Pryce's district. Wikinews contacted Austria by e-mail for a statement, but so far there has been no response.
 Following those discoveries, Wikinews investigated another IP address used by the U.S. House of Representatives. On April 30, 2009, the address 143.231.249.138 made an edit that listed Devin Nunes, the representative for California's 21st congressional district, as being a member of the Nazi Party. The address also made less questionable edits, but after investigating further, it was discovered that the IP address removed critical information on April 29 from the article of Gregory Meeks, the representative for New York's 6th congressional district. The information removed was related to a column by the the New York Times which stated that Meeks initially supported former 2008 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Barack Obama in the race for the White House. According to the Times, Meeks changed his support to Obama because he was part of ""a young black political class [which was] seeking to assert the neighborhood’s power against what it sees as an older establishment, based in Harlem, that has long exercised disproportionate influence in New York City."" 
 The address 143.231.249.138 was also responsible for adding highly biased statements to articles related to abortion. On March 16, 2009 it altered the Wikipedia article Crisis pregnancy center, adding that the centers were ""abortion mills, which exist only to kill people, also present themselves as medical facilities."" On March 20, the IP changed the Project Rachel article to include, ""millions of women have deep regrets and, often, suffer psychological problems after undergoing an abortion--a fact the abortion industry and mass media will not admit."" 143.231.249.141 also added racial slurs and references to gay pedophilia into William A. Donohue's article in February, saying he has ""participated in the controversial act of 'tabeling', in which he takes a small child, places him upon a table, and 'puts the lord inside him.'""
 In an attempt to find out where the edits were being made and by whom, Wikinews contacted the Electronic Frontier Foundation to receive advice on how to file an information request with the U.S. government under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The request would have been made to release the names of the individuals and offices responsible for the edits. However, according to Marcia Hofmann, a staff attorney for the EFF, who specializes in FOIA related matters, the U.S. government is not required to provide the information.
 ""None of the U.S. open government laws extends to records in the possession of members of Congress or their employees. Put differently, it's not so much a question of what the information is (identities of congressional staff) as where the information is (in congressional offices, which aren't covered by open government laws),"" said Hoffmann in an exclusive interview with Wikinews. She also added that ""FOIA [requests] cover records in executive branch agencies and departments"" only.
 Suspicious and/or fraudulent edits to Wikipedia made by Congress and other government entities were first reported by Wikinews in February 2006, after the U.S. government engaged in Wikipedia vandalism and other forms of perceived biased editing of articles. The House of Representatives IP addresses were briefly banned from editing Wikipedia articles in the wake of the initial controversy. A few days later, Wikinews reported that staff members of the offices of United States Senators, using Senate-linked IP addresses, also edited Wikipedia, in some cases, removing facts and sourced material from articles. In 2008, Wikinews also reported that staff members for then 2008 candidates for U.S. president Barack Obama and John McCain made questionable edits to Wikipedia.

"," A visit to Baghdad's ""Green Zone"" on two separate days last week (March 22 and 24, 2005) has convinced Washington's Democratic senators and representatives that things are going well.
 The Senate delegation, led by Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev), visited on Tuesday. The House delegation, led by Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), visited two days later. They all came away from their whirlwind visits with opinions that although conditions were improving there would still be many years of American occupation before Iraq could be a true democracy.
 ""Although progress has been made, there is a significant way to go until the Iraqis are capable of providing for their security,"" said Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. She led an eight-member group that included seven Democrats and Republican Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Vista) (San Diego County).
 The delegations spent their one day in Iraq's Green Zone, the heavily protected area in downtown Baghdad that serves as headquarters for the 150,000 U.S. military forces and diplomats and the Iraqi government. They headed to their other stops in Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Egypt. Security was tight and didn’t allow for any additional travel in the war torn nation.
 The sole Republican in the Congressional delegation, Issa, said ""I believe it will be a fairly long stay.""
 Pelosi’s comments echoed Issa, and added ""the cost of this war is huge to the American people,"" citing 1,500 service personnel the Bush administration has admitted were killed in action, and the estimated $500 million-a-day price tag. ""The message some of us had for our military leaders and Iraqi leaders is that whatever it takes to transfer security responsibilities should be applied now. It's long overdue,"" she added.
 An emotional trip to Beirut, Lebanon, by the congressional delegation included a visit to the grave of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who was assassinated in a Feb. 14 bombing that is  blamed, but not substantiated, to have been committed by Syrian agents. Darrell Issa, of Lebanese descent, noted ""there's a huge permanent group of mourners at his grave, with hundreds of tents set up.'’
 Senator Reid stressed the need for continued U.S. support for reconstruction efforts, along with training Iraqi security forces to replace U.S. military personnel and help bolster the Iraqi economy and political structure. ""Everyone understands that reconstruction is an important part of the U.S. mission here,"" he added.
 Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) agreed: ""I believe what we are seeing here is good.""
 Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), a leading critic of the Bush administration's Iraq policy, seemed upbeat about the future of the new Iraq government. Iraq's future stability ""greatly depends on the training of Iraqi security forces.""
 ""We got a very, very upbeat report from the top U.S. military officials,” she added.
 All of the delegation seemed to agree that their trip enforced the enormity of the challenge and the financial need to help the Iraqi people. This would require a continued input of American taxpayer dollars and left little doubt that they would line up to support the Bush administration’s proposed new $81 billion dollars (US) in expenditures there.

McCotter, who has represented Michigan's 11th congressional district since 2003, has launched a campaign website and plans to publicly announce his intentions Saturday.
 McCotter broke the news during an interview on Detroit's WJR-AM radio station. He has publicly considered running since May when Fox News' Red Eye host Greg Gutfeld asked him if he would enter the race. Last week, McCotter reportedly paid $18,000 to appear in Iowa's Ames Straw Poll in August.
 The run follows the release of McCotter's book Seize Freedom!, whose title serves as his campaign slogan and is featured on his website below the warning: ""Your American Dream is endangered"".  McCotter has outlined five ""core"" principles for his campaign: 
 Although McCotter previously stated that ""if I run, I would be in to win"", he received only two votes in a Republican Leadership Conference straw poll two weeks ago, and lacks the name recognition of his fellow challengers for the nomination. Charlie Cook of the The Cook Political Report rated it ""virtually impossible"" for McCotter to be nominated.
 Other candidates for the Republican nomination include fellow Representatives Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and Ron Paul of Texas as well as former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney,  former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr., former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, and businessman Herman Cain.
 An adviser said McCotter is dissatisfied with the current candidates and ""has something to say and has some ideas and some policies to put out there that nobody else is discussing right now...his presence in the race is going to force these issues and force this discussion that the country has to have right now.""
 According to The Detroit News, next month, as he campaigns for the presidency, McCotter plans to propose a social security reform bill.

"," The U.S. Senate voted 55-43 to approve Priscilla Owen, a long-debated judicial candidate for the appellate bench. The candidate was praised and congratulated by Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist, but called an extremist by Democrat Charles Schumer of New York. 
 The approval comes mere days after the resolution of recent issues about filibuster rules by the Senate, in which it was agreed that the filibuster rules should not be changed, but that it should be used only in ""extraordinary circumstances.""
 Schumer described the Texas judge as someone ""...who puts the rights of employers over employees, who takes no consideration of environmental rights, women's rights or of just average people.""  
 Democratic Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia surprised some by voting for Judge Owen.  ""I voted four times previously not to invoke cloture on Priscilla Owen, because I respected the right of the Senate to hear further debate,"" Mr. Byrd stated. ""Having examined these aspects [of her judicial philosophy], as well as her prior record as a justice on the Texas Supreme Court, I shall vote in support of her nomination."" 
 Supporters describe her as a no-nonsense, consistent conservative that has served well as a state judge.
 Judge Priscilla Owen's nomination had been subject to filibuster since her initial nomination four years ago. The ending of the filibuster debate allowed her nomination to move forward to a vote. Two other controversial nominees, Janice Rogers Brown and William Pryor, are also expected to come to a vote under the terms of the compromise deal.

"," The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued proposed calorie labeling rules requiring most retail food vendors to display the calorie counts in items on their menus and menu boards. The proposed rules, issued Friday and expected to be finalized in 2012, would apply to most restaurants, snack bars, vending machines, coffee shops, drive-through restaurants, and convenience and grocery stores.
 The US Congress required the rules in the health-care reform law  passed in 2010. The  rules proposed by the FDA must undergo a public comment period before they are finalized and take effect, said Michael R. Taylor, Deputy Director for Foods at the FDA.
 The proposed regulations pertain to businesses devoting more than 50 percent of their floor space to the sale of food or that consider themselves restaurants, specifically food-selling chains with at least 20 stores nationally. Included are candy stores, bakeries, and ice-cream parlors.
 The FDA's proposed guidelines specify that chains post the calorie counts of foods and drinks on menus and menu boards or next to the food item, such as at a salad bar. The menu is to prominently exhibit the calorie content of each item in a way customers can see easily, giving them the same information packaged foods prepared at home currently provide. The information must be displayed in ""clear and conspicuous"" print and colors.
 Many cities and states have passed laws requiring calorie labeling on menus, beginning with New York City in 2008. California implemented a similar law in January, although many counties are waiting for the release of the federal guidelines before they begin enforcement. Some fast-food chains there, such as McDonald's and Starbucks, are displaying calorie counts on menus in some of their stores. 
 The rules are intended to curb the national obesity epidemic since, according to FDA estimates, one third of the calories people consume yearly come from food eaten out. In a statement issued yesterday, Kathleen Sebelius, Secretary of Health and Human Services said, ""Giving consumers clear nutritional information makes it easier for them to choose healthier options that can help fight obesity and make us all healthier."" 
 Excluded from the rules are businesses whose primary product is not food sales but that sell it, such as bowling alleys, airports and airplanes, amusement parks, hotels and movie theaters. Alcohol is also excluded.

"," On Wednesday, the attorneys general of fifteen U.S. states filed a lawsuit against United States President Donald Trump for ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, or DACA, which placed a moratorium on the deportation of undocumented immigrants who had come to the U.S. while they were still minors.  They argue that Trump's decision to resume deportation was based on racism and therefore illegal and that deporting DACA beneficiaries would harm the economies of their respective states.
 The suit reads, in part: ""Ending DACA, whose participants are mostly of Mexican origin, is a culmination of President Trump's oft-stated commitments — whether personally held, stated to appease some portion of his constituency, or some combination thereof — to punish and disparage people with Mexican roots."" The greatest number of DACA beneficiaries are from Mexico, and the next most common countries of birth are El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
 According to New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman, his state is home to 42,000 DACA participants, also called dreamers, after the DREAM Act, a proposed law that would have made something similar to the DACA program a law rather than an executive policy. ""Dreamers play by the rules. Dreamers work hard. Dreamers pay taxes. For most of them, America is the only home they've ever known. And they deserve to stay here,"" he said.  According to the lawsuit, 50 DACA participants are students at Harvard University, one the most prestigious schools in the U.S.
 At the U.S. government's last count, the DACA program covered 787,580 people. It allowed undocumented immigrants who had come to the U.S. under the age of 16 and were no older than 30 in 2012 to apply for temporary federal permits for legal residency, which expire after two years.  These in turn allow them to file for work permits and drivers' licenses.  It made it much easier for them to attend four-year colleges and for the government to collect income tax.  The Trump administration describes this as a phasing out rather than an immediate cancellation.  Some DACA participants will be allowed to renew their permits, but only until October and only for participants whose existing permits would expire by next March.
 President Trump invited Congress to take action on the dream issue: ""We will resolve the DACA issue with heart and compassion — but through the lawful Democratic process — while at the same time ensuring that any immigration reform we adopt provides enduring benefits for the American citizens we were elected to serve,"" President Trump told the press on Tuesday. ""We must also have heart and compassion for unemployed, struggling, and forgotten Americans."" Under the new Trump policy, if Congress does not pass a law establishing a program for DACA participants, 300,000 would lose legal status next year.
 Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson, accompanied by now-adult DACA recipients who work for the state legislature, announced to the press, ""It's outrageous, it's not right[...] As attorney general for the state of Washington, I have a hammer, it's the law."" Ferguson also sued Donald Trump earlier this year over a travel ban prohibiting people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.
 DACA was not a law but rather an executive policy established by Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama.  The U.S. Constitution gives the legislative branch of the government, Congress, the duty of establishing laws but the executive branch, headed by the President, the duty of enforcing them.  The DACA program was examined by lawyers from the U.S. Department of Justice in 2014, and they determined then-President Barack Obama did have the authority to decline to enforce existing immigration laws in this way.
 The suit was filed by attorneys general from North Carolina, Hawaii, Washington, New York, Illinois, Iowa, Oregon, New Mexico, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Vermont, and Rhode Island and the country's capital, Washington D.C., all of whom are Democrats.  The attorney general of California, home to one out of four DACA participants, stated intent through a spokesperson to file a separate lawsuit.

 McGovern was a senator for South Dakota from 1963 to 1981. He was the first Democrat elected in South Dakota to that position since 1930.
 He was head of the Food for Peace program under President John F. Kennedy. Later, he was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies for Food and Agriculture from 1998 to 2001. McGovern and Bob Dole received the 2008 World Food Prize for creating a program for international child nutrition and education.
 His family made a statement about his death: ""Our wonderful father, George McGovern, passed away peacefully at the Dougherty Hospice House in Sioux Falls, SD, surrounded by our family and life-long friends"".
 Many politicians have made comments and tributes about  McGovern's death:
 U.S. President Barack Obama said, ""George McGovern dedicated his life to serving the country he loved. ... And after his career in Congress, he became a leading voice in the fight against hunger. ... Michelle and I share our thoughts and prayers with his family.""
 U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said, on behalf of himself and Second Lady Jill Biden, ""Jill and I are profoundly saddened to hear about George McGovern's passing. I was honored to serve with him, to know him, and to call him a friend. ... Above all, George McGovern was a generous, kind, honorable man. He will be missed, and our thoughts and prayers are with his family today.""
 Former U.S. President Bill Clinton said, ""We were deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our friend George McGovern. The world has lost a tireless advocate for human rights and dignity. We first met George while campaigning for him in 1972. ... Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends.""
 U.S. Senator John Kerry said, ""George McGovern was a voice of clarity and conviction at a time [the Vietnam War] when America needed it most.""
 Former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Newt Gingrich said, on CNN, ""George actually was a very complicated person. He had served as a bomber pilot in World War II, he was not a pacifist and his argument over Vietnam was about that particular war.""
 McGovern was born as George Stanley McGovern on July 19, 1922 in Avon, South Dakota. He was raised in Mitchell, South Dakota. He married Eleanor McGovern, and their marriage lasted 64 years until her death at the age of 85 in 2007. During World War II he served as a bomber pilot. They had five children — four daughters and one son.

"," A Texas judge handed down a three-year prison sentence today to Tom DeLay, former US House Majority Leader.  The sentence is a follow-up to a conviction in November of money laundering and conspiracy charges committed in 2002. DeLay, a right-wing Republican, was considered one of the most influential congressman in the history of the United States House of Representatives.  
 The sentence handed down by Judge Pat Priest was originally 8 years behind bars. However, DeLay was allowed to deduct 5 years for the money laundering charge, in exchange for 10 years of community service. DeLay's bail was set at $10,000 while his appeal is pending.  
 In November, DeLay was convicted of funneling hundreds of thousands of dollars to other Texas politicians. Although DeLay was found guilty, he denies all charges of misconduct. ""Judge, I can't be remorseful for something I don't think I did,"" he said.  The prosecuting attorney, Steve Brandt said this non-remorseful sentiment should be cause for more prison time: ""He has shown no remorse, no remorse whatsoever...He needs to go to prison, your honor, and he needs to go today.""

"," Former US Representative Dan Rostenkowski died of lung cancer Wednesday at his vacation home in Genoa City, Wisconsin. Rostenkowski, whose political career ended in the early 1990s after he was convicted on fraud charges, was 82.
 Rostenkowski's death was confirmed by his spokesperson, Jim Jaffe, who said that the former congressman had been receiving treatment for lung cancer for a while. Rostenkowski had previously been treated for prostate cancer in the 1990s.
 Rostenkowski was born on January 2, 1928 in Chicago, Illinois. He was an athlete and declined an invitation to try out for the Philadelphia Athletics (now the Oakland Athletics) in order to pursue a career in politics. Rostenkowski attended St. John's Northwestern Military Academy in Wisconsin, served with the US Army in Korea, and graduated from Loyola University in 1951.
 Rostenkowski's political career was supported by the Cook County political machine, and he became a member of the Illinois state legislature in 1952, one year after graduating from college. In 1958, when he was 30, Rostenkowski was elected to the US House of Representatives. In 1961, he began serving on the United States House Committee on Ways and Means, the chief committee of the House for writing taxes. From 1981–1994, he served as the committee's chairman. Rostenkowski was involved in the creation of Medicare in 1966 and he helped make amendments to the Social Security system in 1983.
 In 1992, a federal jury began an inquiry into the House post office, and Rostenkowski was accused of buying US$22,000 in stamps with government funds and then turning them into cash. The investigation, which lasted two years, led to Republican allegations of corruption within the Democratic party. In 1994, Rostenkowski was charged with 17 felony counts, including the use of federal money to purchase furniture, and obstruction of justice. In order to avoid a trial, Rostenkowski made a deal with prosecutors, pleading guilty to two counts of mail fraud in exchange for fifteen months in prison, two months in a halfway house, and a US$100,000 fine.
 Rostenkowski, who was not reelected for a nineteenth term in Congress in 1994, continued to maintain his innocence, and was pardoned by US President Bill Clinton in 2000.

"," A funeral procession several kilometers long wound its way through the Lebanese capital of Beirut for the former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri yesterday. Mr Hariri was assassinated three days ago, on the 14th of February, when explosives equivalent to approximately 300 kg of TNT were detonated as his motorcade drove past the St George Hotel in the Lebanese capital. The hundreds of thousands of mourners in the funeral procession were convinced that the assassination was carried out by the Syrian government and used the opportunity to voice their anger at the Syrians. 
 The funeral united the many Lebanese factions, with Christians, Druze, and Shia and Sunni Muslims marching side by side in the procession, accompanied by the tolling of church bells.
 French President Jacques Chirac, a friend to Mr Hariri, was in Beirut yesterday and praised the work that Mr Hariri had done in his fight for Lebanese democracy and independence. He also offered his condolences to Mr Hariri's family.
 The US House of Representatives has paid tribute to the former Lebanese Prime Minister and also called for Syria to withdraw troops from Lebanon. Mr Hariri was described as a philanthropist who chose to put the future of Lebanon above political interests and used his own funds to assist the country's economic reconstruction after years of civil war.
 Darrell Issa, a California Republican, said demonstrations by Lebanese calling for Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon underscore the key issue facing the country, ""There is no proof that Syria was directly responsible for this assassination,” he said.  “But there is no doubt that Syria has remained in Lebanon far longer either than their mandate, or than in the agreements under the Taif Accords of 1989.""
 Nick Rahall, a West Virginia Democrat, also took to the floor of the House to denounce the killing. ""It was a criminal act, it was a heinous act of terrorism, of those who don't have the courage to work through the political system or differences.  I do not know who is to blame, certainly there are enough outside forces in the region that once again are looking to Lebanon to play their ugly, deadly games,"" he said.
 The United States withdrew its ambassador from Damascus following the bomb attack, and has again demanded that Syria withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

 ""Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted on a financial rescue plan that had been negotiated by Congressional leaders of both parties and my administration,"" Bush reminded the audience. ""Unfortunately, the measure was defeated by a narrow margin. I'm disappointed by the outcome, but I assure our citizens and citizens around the world that this is not the end of the legislative process.""
 ""Producing legislation is complicated, and it can be contentious. It matters little what a path a bill takes to become law,"" he continued. ""We're at a critical moment for our economy, and we need legislation that decisively address the troubled assets now clogging the financial system, helps lenders resume the flow of credit to consumers and businesses, and allows the American economy to get moving again.""
 Market Data ""I recognize this is a difficult vote for members of Congress. Many of them don't like the fact that our economy has reached this point, and I understand that. But the reality is that we are in an urgent situation, and the consequences will grow worse each day if we do not act. The dramatic drop in the stock market that we saw yesterday will have a direct impact on the retirement accounts, pension funds, and personal savings of millions of our citizens. And if our nation continues on this course, the economic damage will be painful and lasting.""
World and US markets today are up after severe declines yesterday. Most have recovered 30% of their previous losses, meaning that the potential government expenditure was similar to the market losses.
 Bush then said that he knows ""many Americans are especially worried about the cost of the legislation."" He then attempted to justify the cost. ""The bill the House considered yesterday commits up to 700 billion taxpayer dollars to purchase troubled assets from banks and other financial institutions. That, no question, is a large amount of money. We're also dealing with a large problem. But to put that in perspective, the drop in the stock market yesterday represented more than a trillion dollars in losses.""
 If passed, the bailout plan would have allowed for the United States government to purchase devalued mortgage backed securities, resulting from the subprime mortgage crisis, from troubled financial institutions. The US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the plan could cost up to $700 billion.

 Gillibrand, 42, was a member of the House of Representatives from Hudson and is, like Clinton, a member of the Democratic Party.
 ""I believe I have found the best candidate to become the next senator from the state of New York. She is dynamic, she is articulate, she is perceptive, she is outspoken,"" said Paterson at a news conference.
 This selection came after Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy and leading candidate for the job, withdrew from the consideration for the seat on January 21 due to unspecified personal reasons. Kennedy was one of approximately 20 candidates that Governor Paterson said he considered for the position, including fellow New York Congressmen Carolyn Maloney and Jerrold Nadler.
 New York's attorney general Andrew Cuomo was also considered. Cuomo was the top choice in voter opinion polls, according to CNN.
 Clinton expressed approval of the appointment in a statement: ""Kirsten is an intelligent and dedicated public servant and a dear friend. I'm pleased that this seat, which has been my great honor to hold, and which has in its history been held by leaders like former Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Robert F. Kennedy, will be in such capable hands.""
 President Obama also approved of her, stating, ""Kirsten has been a strong voice for transparency and reform in government and shares the belief that government should be open, accessible and work for all our citizens.""
 In statements, Gillibrand said that she will be a supporter of same-sex marriage and an advocate for women's rights. She has also promised a state economic stimulus package that would support New York's education as well as put forth funding for the environment and a new project that would create a high-speed rail system linking New York City with Albany, the state capital.
 The appointment has been criticized by gun-control and immigration advocates. In particular Gillibrand's opinion on gun control laws has been rebuked, including her stance opposing restrictions on parts of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlines the right of citizens to bear arms, earning her support by the National Rifle Association.
 ""When I heard Gillibrand was his pick, I thought it was a joke. This is an insult to the families of gun violence victims across the state. Shame on Governor Paterson,"" stated Gloria Cruz of the Million Mom March which promoted tighter restrictions on the private ownership of firearms.

This comes after the House voted to refer the matter to the Department of Justice last month for consideration.
 Bannon is facing two counts of contempt of Congress relating to his failure to appear at a deposition and for failing to turn over subpoenaed documents.

The sixteen-year-old Swede is currently the youngest recipient of the 92-year-old award. Thunberg received the award, with which Time credits an individual as having done ""for better or for worse [...] the most to influence the events of the year"", for her work drawing attention to the issue of climate change.
 Thunberg began her climate protest on August 20, 2018, at the age of fifteen, outside of the Swedish Parliament, instead of attending school. She protested alone on the first day, but thousands of Swedes eventually joined the protest. That September, the Fridays for Future movement launched; Thunberg promised protests every week until Sweden joined the Paris Agreement. Other countries had similar protests, with 35 thousand students protesting in Belgium in January of this year.
 Thunberg then led, according to Time, the largest climate change demonstration ever held to date, on September 20 of this year. An estimated four million people overall took part in the protests. This included marches of 250 thousand protesters in New York City, 100 thousand in London, and 1.4 million in cities throughout Germany. Time reported some were using the slogan ""Make the World Greta Again"".
 In her campaign, Thunberg has met with multiple world leaders advocating climate change action, including giving an address at the United Nations, meeting with Roman Catholic Pope Francis, and speaking to the United States Congress. Her influence also resulted in a Nobel Peace Prize nomination. 
 According to NBC, Time also considered the United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, United States President Donald Trump, protesters in Hong Kong over Chinese extradition, and a United States whistleblower who revealed an alleged illicit interaction between Trump and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.

US$300 checks would be sent to people on low-income including retirees on Social Security which was not included in the original bill backed by President George W. Bush. The plan would begin to decrease rebates for citizens with taxable incomes of US$75,000 for individuals and US$150,000 for couples. The checks would go out to more than a 130 million Americans according to Treasury secretary Henry Paulson.
 The House overwhelmingly approved the more broad Senate amended bill which included the low-income portion mentioned above along with provisions that would keep illegal aliens from receiving a rebate check.

 Campbell called the plan ""wealth redistribution"" and noted it did not have safeguards to prevent illegals from receiving these rebates and also claimed that stimulus plan would increase the deficit more and noted the cause of the looming recession was because of ""credit problems.""
 The United States Senate voted hours earlier on the bill which passed in the Senate, 81–16. after having to shed some incentives included by Senate Democrats which caused the bill to fail.

 Blagojevich is facing charges of attempting to sell the state's opening for United States Senator when president-elect Barack Obama takes office on January 20. The vote will now move to the Illinois State Senate, where a two-thirds majority will be needed to officially remove Blagojevich from the position of Governor of Illinois.
 Blagojevich was arrested on December 9 on suspicion of corruption charges, and was recommended for impeachment after an investigation from the United States House of Representatives. Blagojevich is the first United States governor to be impeached since 1988, when Evan Mecham of Arizona was impeached after a year and three months on the job.
 At the beginning of the voting debate, impeachment committee leader Barbara Flynn Currie, a member of the United States Democratic Party and representing Chicago, said that Blagojevich's alleged actions: ""Show a public servant who is prepared to turn public service into an avenue for private benefit. They show a public servant who has betrayed his oath of office, who has betrayed the public trust, who is not fit to govern the state of Illinois.""
 She later said ""The totality of the evidence shows that Gov. Blagojevich has forfeited his right to hold office. Whatever their stations, whether petty thieves or governors, those who break the law must not be immune from the consequences and must be held to account for their actions."" Milton Patterson, a Democrat also representing Chicago, was the only member of the House of Representatives to vote against the impeachment of Blagojevich, but did not speak in defense of him. 
 The report that recommended his impeachment heavily criticized Blagojevich's actions. It stated that ""the governor repeatedly demonstrated that his decision to appoint a senator would not be based on merits of the candidate or on public policy, but rather on how that appointment could benefit him personally. It added ""The governor directed various individuals to conduct inquiries on his behalf to negotiate deals for the Senate appointment, affirmatively setting into action a plot to trade the Senate appointment for something of value to the governor."" 
 Jack D. Franks, a Democratic representative also on the committee, also spoke, saying that ""it’s our duty to clean up this mess and stop the freak show that has become government in Illinois. I believe we’re finally doing what we should have done a long time ago.""
 If Blagojevich's impeachment is ratified by the State Senate, he would immediately be removed from the office of governor and the state's Lieutenant Governor, Pat Quinn, would become the state's acting governor.

The two candidates together had spent more money on this campaign than on any other House contest in U.S. history, over US$50 million.
 The congressional seat was left vacant when its previous congressman, Tom Price, accepted an offer to serve in President Donald Trump's cabinet.  The sixth district is considered heavily Republican and has not been held by a Democrat since the 1970s.  Despite this, 30-year-old Ossoff nearly won the initial election in April, with 48.1% of the vote.  At that time, among several Republican candidates, Handel came away with 19.8% of the vote.
 Some, including Ossoff himself, characterized this election a chance for voters to indicate whether they truly approve or disapprove of the Trump presidency, saying that the election could ""send a message that will be heard across the country and around the world."" After the election, he conceded, saying, ""As darkness has crept across this planet, [Ossoff supporters] have provided a beacon of hope for people here in Georgia and people around the world[.] We showed the world that in places where no one thought it was even possible to fight, we could fight.""
 Both candidates received death threats during the campaign and spoke with the press about violence in U.S. politics. In remarks to The Guardian, Handel said, ""The lack of civility in society as a whole, some of it, I believe, is very much fueled by social media and frankly, it's fueled by the fact that journalism is not journalism any more.  It's tabloid. [...] The anger has been from the left with groups of trackers showing up and literally adopting a gang-like posture and virtually stalking individuals.""
 Ossoff commented as well: ""This is a deep-rooted problem in American politics right now which is going to take work and bipartisan commitment to try to heal wounds and focus on substance instead of fear-mongering and slander."" He specifically objected to an ad that he said politicized the recent shooting of Republican Representative Stephen Scalise by saying that violent leftists were voting for Ossoff.
 Over 140,000 people, an extraordinarily high number for a special election in the area, voted early.

"," Patrick Leahy (D-VT), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, remarked today that Congress was ready to go to court if the White House continues to refuse to comply with subpoenas for information regarding the firing of federal prosecutors. Leahy said that the committee could seek to charge the Bush Administration with criminal contempt of Congress if it did not provide public testimony in the matter.
 ""They’ve chosen confrontation rather than compromise or cooperation,"" said Leahy on the 'Meet the Press' news program. ""The bottom line is in the U.S. attorney investigation, we have people manipulating law enforcement. Law enforcement can’t be partisan."" 
 The investigation questions whether the White House illegally exerted undue political influence in the firing of 8 federal prosecutors.  The Democratic-led investigation could result in a Constitutional showdown over issues of executive privilege and congressional oversight.
 The Senate has also subpoenaed the White House and Vice President Dick Cheney’s office for documents related to the administration’s 'Warrantless Wiretapping' within the United States. In this case, lawyers for Vice President Cheney first argued that the Vice President's role in the Senate meant that Cheney wasn't part of the Executive Branch. This legal claim generated substantial criticism and a failed attempt to get funding for Cheney's executive role cut off.  White House lawyer David Addington and others in the administration have since backed away from this argument. 
 A number of procedural matters remain before criminal contempt proceedings can begin. The committee must formally reject claims of executive privilege and then must vote to find the President in contempt of Congress. Such a vote must be confirmed by the whole Senate before being sent to a U.S. attorney, who must also concur before a formal charge can be established. The House of Representatives may also bring contempt charges independent of the Senate if it so chooses. Such charges are rarely brought by either body of Congress: just ten cases since 1975, and most result in settlement agreements prior to the commencement of a trial.

"," After the bombing of a military recruiting station in New York City's Times Square, police in Washington, D.C. are investigating letters addressed to ""members of Congress"", which contain a picture of the recruiting station before the explosion and the message ""Happy New Year, We Did It"". 
 The letters arrived at Capitol Hill Thursday in manila envelopes, according to an anonymous Democratic aide who is investigating the matter. The picture was accompanied by what seemed to be a 10 page manifesto against the Iraq War. Also included was a booklet, which the aide says he cannot identify.
 Another aide who is part of the investigation says similar letters arrived in up to ten offices. In an email sent by California senator Diane Feinstein, recipients were urged to leave the letters alone and call police. 
 A congressional staffer describes the person in the photo as a white man with red hair, apparently in his 30s.
 In a statement, the Capitol Police said, ""The U.S. Capitol Police and the FBI are working together to investigate letters received by various members of Congress. There is no established connection between these letters and the New York City Times Square incident this morning. The investigation is ongoing...more details as they become available.""
 No one was injured in the explosion, which occurred around 3:40 a.m. Thursday. The small bomb caused only minor damage to the recruiting station, shattering a glass door and leaving a hole in a window.

"," Olympia Snowe, three-term moderate Republican United States Senator from Maine, announced yesterday that she will not seek election to a fourth term in the 2012 elections.
 In her announcement, Snowe cited the ""atmosphere of polarization and 'my way or the highway' ideologies"" as a reason for not seeking reelection to another term in the U.S. Senate. The announcement, which was released by Snowe's campaign office this afternoon, was later confirmed by Justin Brasell, the Senator's campaign manager.
 According to a campaign aide to Snowe, Sharon Miller, the senator had been considering the decision for several weeks; ""She was really struggling with it. But her timing is the same as Sen. George Mitchell and Sen. Bill Cohen, who also made their decisions very close to the deadline"".
 Snowe served in the United States Congress for 33 years. Fellow Maine Senator Susan Collins said the announcement was a ""complete surprise"", and that it ""devastated"" her.
 Snowe's decision not to seek reelection to her Senate seat has energized Democrats, who have a chance at winning the seat this fall, helping to defend their 51 seat to 47 seat majority in the body.
 The announcement also took Senate Republican leadership by surprise; minority leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and National Republican Senatorial Committee chairman John Cornyn of Texas reportedly were informed of Snowe's decision yesterday. According to one Republican, Snowe had sent a fundraiser invitation out on Monday.
 Those mentioned as possible contenders for Snowe's Senate seat include 2002 Republican gubernatorial candidate Peter Cianchette, Snowe's husband and Republican former Maine Governor Jock McKernan, and Democratic Representatives Chellie Pingree and Mike Michaud.

 Senator Barbara Mikulski spoke for several minutes, calling Biden a 'champion of the people' and a 'great leader'. Mikulski also praised Biden's wife, calling her a leader 'in her own right.' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky called Biden a 'real friend and trusted partner.' Although scheduled to run for one hour, the tribute extended beyond two hours.
 Two senators mentioned Biden's work on the Violence Against Women Act, and commented on the positive impact made by that legislation. In January of this year, President Obama asked Biden to lead an effort to target cancer diagnosis and treatment. At least two Senators praised Biden's efforts on that program, named the 'Cancer Moonshot' program. 
 Earlier in the week, Biden presided over a vote on the $1.8 billion bill, intended to fund the 'Cancer Moonshot' effort. Biden's son Beau died of a brain tumor in 2015.

"," Nancy Pelosi yesterday resumed the office of Speaker of the House, being voted into the position by the incoming 116th United States Congress.
 The new members of the House of Representatives, which include 235 Democrats and 199 Republicans, voted for Pelosi to serve as Speaker with 220 votes.  Republican Kevin McCarthy, who held the post of Speaker this past term, received 192.
 ""I pledge that this Congress will be transparent, bipartisan and unifying; that we will seek to reach across the aisle in this Chamber and across the divisions across our nation,"" Pelosi told the public.  Guests at the swearing in included Pelosi's grandchildren and such celebrities as fashion designer Tim Gunn and Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart.
 President Donald Trump congratulated Pelosi, saying, ""hopefully we're going to have a lot of things that we can get done together.""
 Pelosi has said her plans for the new term will begin with less controversial issues with which she could find common ground with Republicans, but Democrats also plan to address the current government shutdown promptly.
 About a quarter of the U.S. federal government, 800,000 employees, is not in operation because President Trump and the previous Congress could not reach an agreement about the national budget.  President Trump has said he will not approve a budget that does not allocate funding for a wall along the country's border with Mexico.  Pelosi has proposed legislation that would fund the government through September.  For the budget to pass, it must also be approved by the Senate, which has a Republican majority, and it must be signed by President Trump.
 Within her own party, the choice of Pelosi was not uncontested.  Some called for younger leadership. Altogether, fifteen Democrats defected.  Pelosi had agreed to support some of her opponents' plans, such as term limits for individuals serving as Speaker.
 The 116th U.S. Congress has the greatest number of women, 102, and people of color in the country's history and also has the youngest average age.
 Nancy Pelosi became the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House in 2007 and held the post until 2011. The Speaker of the House is the third-highest ranking person in the U.S. Federal government and automatically assumes the presidency if the President and Vice President are both killed or incapacitated.
 Unlike Senators, who serve six-year terms, members of the House are elected for two-year terms.  As such, every member of the House is either re-elected or replaced during every federal election.

 The senators criticized the NFL for their new domestic violence policy enacted in August. The new policy says a player will receive a six game suspension for their first offense. 
 A video of Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice assaulting the woman who has since married him was recently released by website TMZ.  The assault took place in a elevator at an Atlantic City, New Jersey casino.  Rice was initially given a two game suspension; later, following the video release, the Ravens terminated Rice's contract and the NFL indefinitely suspended him. 
 The bipartisan group of senators said, ""If you violently assault a woman, you shouldn't get a second chance to play in the NFL."" 
 The league stated they had initiated an independent investigation by former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller into the Rice incident.

"," When the curtains were drawn and the anthem began, confusion flickered over the faces in the large hall which welcomed the NRA (National Rifle Association) to Houston. It was the sounds of rocker Ted Nugent’s rendition of the Star Spangled Banner. People didn’t know whether to put their hands over their heart, as was customary, or start clapping. According to reports, it was hard to determine what the ""Motor City Madman"" was doing.
 That was the rowdy kick off Friday night of the convention expected to draw up to 60,000 people to the George R. Brown convention center for a weekend of guns, gun-politics, gun peripherals like scopes and carry bags, and stuffed trophy heads.
 NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre told about 2000 listeners to ""Let the enemies of freedom take notice, we in this room have beaten you…"" He repeated it three times for effect.
 Another opening act was country singer Charlie Daniels whose rant against those on the left of the political spectrum included a characterization of them as ""save the whales and kill the babies pantywaists."" He then pursed his lips and did his interpretation of a pantywaist, according to the Houston Chronicle: ""’If we just leave the terrorists alone, they’d leave us alone.’""
 Elsewhere, visitors were charmed by stuffed heads of dead deer. NRA staffer Monty Embrey, working the booth with the heads, said that although they looked like small moose, they were full-blooded deer with unusual antlers.
 The exhibit is owned by the NRA and travels around the country. ""People don't get to see a collection of heads very often. It’s a big deal,"" said Embrey.
 Saturday’s keynote address will come from right wing congressional representative Tom DeLay of Sugarland, Texas, whose district includes much of Houston.
 Just Friday, another of DeLay's most conservative associates became the second House Republican to ask DeLay to consider yielding his leadership post because of the many ethics problems that have dogged him.
 Rep. Tom Tancredo, (R-Colo) said, ""If the majority leader were to temporarily step aside so that these trumped up charges can be dealt with in a less hostile environment, as they have proven to be an unnecessary distraction, it may be a productive move."" 
 These comments follow on the heels of similar statements by Rep. Chris Shays, a Republican moderate from Connecticut and Rick Santorum, Republican Senator from Pennsylvania. All are concerned that the man in a political leadership position is a liability to their reelection bids, expected next year. He has not  assuaged three charges against him by the Congressional Ethics Committee, comprised of half Republican and half Democratic members, except to blame his political opposition.
 DeLay's record keeping on millions of dollars was minimal and he has allegedly accepted money from Texas corporations in violation of the Texas law.
 ""A Travis County grand jury indicted DeLay political aide Jim Ellis, fundraiser Warren RoBold and John Colyandro, the executive director of DeLay's political action committee, Texans for a Republican Majority, known as TRMPAC.The Washington Post reported in September that eight corporations also were indicted for illegal political contributions.""
 The subject of DeLay's speech was not known at press time.

"," The following is the third edition of a monthly series chronicling the U.S. 2016 presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.
 In this month's edition on the campaign trail: two individuals previously interviewed by Wikinews announce their candidacies for the Reform Party presidential nomination; a former Republican Congressman comments on the Republican National Convention; and Wikinews interviews an historic Democratic National Convention speaker.
 As July started, presumptive Democratic Party presidential nominee Hillary Clinton met with the FBI to discuss the private e-mail server she used as Secretary of State. A few days later, FBI Director James Comey held a press conference where he announced that charges would not be appropriate against Clinton. He noted, however, that Clinton had acted carelessly in installing a private e-mail server for State business and had risked compromising State secrets. Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump tweeted that the lack of charges in the case showed ""the system is totally rigged!"" Polls from the early part of the month gave Clinton a slight lead in the race. She led the July 4 Real Clear Politics average 44.9% to 40.3%. At this time, media interest in the running-mate selections of Trump and Clinton intensified. The Washington Post speculated that New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich were the leading contenders to be Trump's running mate. However, other reports pointed to Indiana governor Mike Pence, who confirmed he would accept the position if asked. Trump commented that ten names were on the shortlist including some not mentioned in the media. In later days, General Michael Flynn was floated as a possibility in reports. Gingrich, Flynn, and Pence were apparently finalists for the position, with Pence believed to be the favorite. For the Democrats, Senator Cory Booker, Congressman Xavier Becerra and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro received mention as potential running mates for Clinton, but the shortlist reportedly included Senators Elizabeth Warren, Tim Kaine, Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
 On July 7, Trump arrived in Washington D.C. and met with Republican members from the House of Representatives and Senate. During the meeting, Trump reportedly told the attendees if they did not support his candidacy, they were, in effect, supporting Clinton. Trump agreed to allow his former rival, Senator Ted Cruz, to speak at the convention, but he did not secure an endorsement from Cruz. The next day, both Trump and Clinton canceled campaign events as an African American shooter in Dallas killed five police officers. Trump's state chairman in Virginia blamed the shooting on Clinton and others ""who label police as racists."" In the aftermath, Trump proclaimed himself the ""law and order candidate."" Ahead of its convention, the GOP platform committee approved a socially conservative platform that opposed same-sex marriage and identified pornography as a ""public health crisis."" The convention's host, Ohio governor John Kasich, a former presidential rival of Trump, would not endorse Trump and claimed through a spokesman that Trump had asked Kasich join the presidential ticket in May, but Kasich had declined. Trump's spokesman denied the claim. Another former rival, former Florida governor Jeb Bush, said he might vote for Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson instead of Trump. On the other side, Hillary Clinton's principal rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, dropped his campaign and officially endorsed Clinton. Clinton also seemingly received support from Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who called Trump ""a faker"" and wondered why he has ""gotten away"" with not releasing his tax returns. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy questioned whether the country was ""well served"" with a Supreme Court justice openly discussing her political views. Trump referred to Ginsburg's comments as ""highly inappropriate."" Ginsburg later apologized.
 Trump announced he would officially name his running mate on July 15. Though Pence was the favorite to receive the nod, Trump met with Senator Jeff Sessions, and had additional meetings with Christie and Gingrich. According to multiple news reports, Trump's daughter Ivanka, her husband Jared Kushner, and financier Sheldon Adelson all tried to convince Trump to select Gingrich, while campaign manager Paul Manafort favored Pence, and pollster Tony Fabrizio wanted Flynn. CNN reported Trump had offered the position to Pence, who accepted. According to NBC, the purported leak of the news had left Trump ""seething."" Due to the July 14 attack in Nice, France, Trump postponed the planned announcement. Both CNN and NBC reported Trump was looking for ways to get out of the selection of Pence. The campaign denied the report. The New York Times alleged the Pence selection was revisited because Christie had begged the campaign to reconsider its decision and replace Pence with himself. On July 15, Trump officially announced via Twitter that he had selected Pence. Through the selection, Trump said he hoped to unify the party. Manafort said the ticket would appeal to former supporters of Sanders. As the GOP convention approached, Manafort declared the #NeverTrump movement ""gone,"" as the GOP rules committee voted not to unbind delegates. Clinton announced she would reveal her vice presidential selection after the GOP convention. The Washington Post tapped Vilsack as the favorite.
 As the GOP convention began in Cleveland, Ohio, Trump trailed Clinton in the July 18 Real Clear Politics average 40.6% to 43.8%. Although Ohio was hosting the convention, the state's delegates were not placed in the front as is tradition. This was believed to be punishment for Governor Kasich's refusal to endorse Trump or attend the convention. Manafort called Kasich's absence a ""big mistake"" and ""embarrassing [to] his state."" With the release of the lineup of speakers showing many members of Trump's family, former RNC chairman Michael Steele called the convention ""a [Trump] family affair.""
 On the opening day, on the floor of the convention at Quicken Loans Arena, anti-Trump delegates unsuccessfully attempted to force a roll call vote on the convention rules. Protests outside were relatively minor with only 24 arrests throughout the entire convention. During the convention speeches, delegates frequently chanted ""Lock her up!"" in reference to Hillary Clinton. Patricia Smith, mother of diplomat Sean Smith who died in the 2012 Benghazi attack, blamed Clinton for her son's death and exclaimed, ""Hillary belongs in prison. She deserves to be in stripes."" In his speech, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani commented Clinton ""would go to jail"" if he were allowed to prosecute her.  In the prime-time opening-night speech, Trump's wife Melania delivered a speech that initially received acclaim. However, this changed once the media pointed out some lines were nearly identical to those from the speech of First Lady Michelle Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. 
 The Trump campaign spent most of the second day of the convention explaining away the plagiarism flap as speechwriter Meredith McIver took the blame for the passages and offered to quit. Trump requested she remain.  Trump officially received the presidential nomination on the second day of the convention and Pence received the vice-presidential nomination.  Christie delivered a speech in which he held a mock trial prosecuting Clinton in absentia before the delegates. He was followed with prime-time speeches by Trump's children Tiffany and Donald Jr.
 On the third day, The New York Times released a transcript of an interview with Trump in which he criticized NATO and questioned whether the US should honor the treaty if member nations do not contribute their share of funds. Several Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said they disagreed with Trump's comments. Disagreements seeped into the convention as well when Cruz gave a speech in which he did not endorse Trump. When his refusal became evident, a chorus of boos erupted from the delegates, continuing until he left the stage. The speech overshadowed that of Pence who accepted the vice-presidential nomination later that night. Cruz received almost universal condemnation from prominent Republicans. However, Gingrich, who spoke after Trump's son Eric, who followed Cruz, commented he did not take the speech to show a lack of support for Trump. Manafort and Donald Trump Jr. claimed it had helped Republicans unite behind Trump. 
 On the last day of the convention, after a formal introduction from Ivanka, Trump accepted the GOP nomination and delivered, CNN noted, the longest nominee acceptance speech in 40 years. In the speech, Trump emphasized ""law and order"", and referenced his proposals of building a wall along the southern border and banning immigration from nations with a history of terrorism. Trump described the legacy of his opponent Clinton as one of ""death, destruction, terrorism, and weakness."" President Barack Obama criticized the speech, accusing Trump of basing it on fear and inaccurately painting a bleak portrait of the nation. Nevertheless, a CNN/ORC instant poll showed 57% of respondents who watched the speech received it favorably and 56% were more likely to vote for Trump. According to pundit Joe Trippi, the speech and overall convention provided the GOP with about a 5.9% bounce in the polls, one point higher than the average. Most polls at this time showed Trump leading Clinton. 
 A day after the convention, Clinton announced her vice-presidential selection. The New York Times had reported that Clinton's husband, former President Bill Clinton, wanted Clinton to pick Senator Tim Kaine. Indeed, she named Kaine, a centrist from Virginia, as her running mate. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus called Clinton-Kaine a ""failed Democrat status quo"" ticket.
 Ahead of the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Wikileaks released nearly 20 thousand hacked Democratic National Committee (DNC) e-mails. The e-mails showed favoritism of Clinton within the DNC and revealed plans to diminish the Sanders campaign. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned her position as a result. Initially, she was to gavel-in the convention, but after a highly negative reception from her home state Florida delegation before the convention, she was replaced with DNC Secretary Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. Media reports and the Clinton campaign itself blamed Russia for the hacking and leaking of e-mails. The DNC issued an apology to Sanders. Sanders urged his supporters not to protest on the floor of the convention. He was booed upon reiterating his support for Clinton before a group of delegates. Presumptive Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein invited Sanders to meet with her, but Sanders declined. Via Twitter, Trump said Sanders had ""sold out."" 
 On the first day of the convention, the first speakers received boos upon mentioning Clinton with the crowd erupting into chants of ""Bernie! Bernie!"" and ""Count our votes!"" As the convention continued, the protests died down inside Wells Fargo Center, but continued outside. Overall, a total of 103 citations were issued in lieu of arrests, while the Secret Service arrested eleven. As the convention moved along, commentators oddly noted a common theme of ""American exceptionalism"" in speeches and more religious references than at the RNC. On the first night, Michelle Obama addressed the convention in a well received speech. She did not mention Trump by name, but referenced his slogan in proclaiming, ""don't let anyone ever tell you that this country isn't great, that somehow we need to make it great again. Because this right now is the greatest country on earth!"" She heaped praise upon Clinton, whom she called a leader ""guided every day by the love and hope and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our children.""  She was followed by the keynote speaker Elizabeth Warren, who opened a blistering attack on Trump, accusing him of defrauding people. Sanders spoke. He expressed disappointment in the outcome of the primaries but heralded the ""historical accomplishments"" of his movement and urged his followers to get behind Clinton.  
 In a historic moment on the second day, Clinton officially received the Democratic presidential nomination, making her the first woman to be nominated by a major party. That night, her husband, former President Bill Clinton, addressed the convention, discussing his relationship with his wife and highlighting her accomplishments.  Before the convention convened on the third day, Trump held a press conference. Referencing the DNC hack leak, he remarked, ""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing."" The Clinton campaign attacked Trump for ""actively encourag[ing] a foreign power to conduct espionage against his political opponent,"" though Trump claimed he was merely joking. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange commented in an interview that he timed the release of the hacked e-mails to hurt Clinton in the election.
 On the third day, after a speech from Vice President Joe Biden, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, addressed the convention. He formally endorsed Clinton and referred to Trump as a ""con,"" arguing, ""[t]he richest thing about Trump is his hypocrisy."" Later, Kaine officially accepted the vice-presidential nomination. President Obama followed with a speech to wrap up the third day. He argued that no one, himself included, was ""more qualified than Hillary Clinton to serve as president of the United States of America."" He accused Trump of offering ""no serious solutions to pressing problems — just the fanning of resentment, and blame, and anger, and hate.""
 On the final day, Chelsea Clinton spoke and introduced her mother, Hillary Clinton, who accepted the Democratic nomination. During her speech, Clinton laid out policy proposals and attacked Trump for making some of his products overseas. In addition, she argued that Trump cannot be trusted with nuclear weapons. Clinton's speech was deemed a success. A CNN instant poll revealed 71% of viewers had a favorable opinion of the speech with 60% more likely to vote for her after watching. Although Trump's speech received higher television ratings, Clinton overtook Trump in post-convention polls. 
 Press coverage of Clinton's speech was overshadowed by an earlier speech from Khizr and Ghazala Khan, a Muslim couple whose son died in Iraq in 2004.  The speech set off a back-and-forth between Trump and Khan that lasted several days.  With his wife at his side on the convention stage, Khizr Khan delivered a stinging attack on Trump for his earlier proposal to ban Muslim immigration and wondered whether Trump had ever read the U.S. Constitution.  Trump responded, attacking Khizr for his comments and questioning whether Khizr's wife remained silent during the speech because she was not allowed to speak. Trump's comments were condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike.  Khizr labeled Trump ""void of decency"" and accused him of having a ""dark heart.""  Ghazala responded with an op-ed in The Washington Post in which she attributed her silence at the convention to grief.  
 As July came to a close, Trump had additional setbacks.  First, he mistakenly asserted that no Russian troops were currently in Ukraine.  Second, he made an unsupported claim that the NFL had complained to him about the presidential debate schedule coinciding with NFL games. Nevertheless, Trump received some positive news with the announcement that Julian Assange had ""extremely interesting"" information on Clinton that had yet to be released through Wikileaks.  In the July 31 Real Clear Politics average, Clinton, who had just received the endorsement of billionaire Mark Cuban, held a 1.1% lead over Trump .
 Two candidates who each previously spoke with Wikinews have both announced their candidacies for the 2016 presidential nomination of the Reform Party of the United States. Historian Darcy Richardson and businessman Rocky De La Fuente each decided to seek the nomination in July. Both have previously run for president as Democrats.
 Richardson, a veteran of third-party politics, sought the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination in 2012 and briefly vied for the Reform Party presidential nomination that same year. He is the author of ""The Others"" anthology, covering third-party candidates, and has written books on such political topics as the 1968 presidential election and the presidential candidacies of Eugene McCarthy, George McGovern, and recently, Bernie Sanders. He served as campaign manager during McCarthy's 1988 presidential bid. In addition, he ran for Pennsylvania Auditor General in 1980, and was the Consumer Party's 1988 nominee for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. In 2010, he ran for Lieutenant Governor of Florida as the running mate of gubernatorial candidate Farid Khavari.
 Richardson has a history within the Reform Party beyond his 2012 run. He participated in the party's 1996 and 2000 mail-in primaries, was part of the 2004 nominating conference calls, donated to candidates nominated by the party, and contributed to the Reform National Committee. Richardson says Reform Party Secretary Nicholas Hensley encouraged him to enter the 2016 race. As the nominee, he plans to spread the party message through television, radio, and speaking engagements. 
 ""In short, my candidacy is designed to remind older folks about the Reform Party’s important role in American politics"", says Richardson, ""and to inform younger millennials — those facing a low-paying, if not jobless, future — that there was and is a party that was opposed to NAFTA, CAFTA, the WTO and other unfair trade agreements and which is still deeply committed to the Hamiltonian idea of protecting U.S. jobs and industry as we proceed into the 21st Century."" 
 De La Fuente, a San Diego businessman with properties throughout the world, got his start in the automobile industry and has since branched into the banking and real estate markets. Before his 2016 Democratic Party campaign for president, he had not sought political office, but did serve as the first-ever Hispanic superdelegate, at the 1992 Democratic National Convention. During his 2016 presidential campaign, which he began largely as a reaction to the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, De La Fuente qualified for the ballot in 48 Democratic primary contests. In addition to seeking the Reform Party nomination, he is current attempting to qualify for the general election ballot in several states as an independent or as the nominee of the new ""American Delta Party,"" which he founded. De La Fuente is currently running in the Democratic Party primary for U.S. Senate in Florida as well. According to Hensley, in remarks to Wikinews, ballot access expert Richard Winger encouraged De La Fuente to seek the Reform Party nomination.
 According to Richardson, De La Fuente entered the race a mere 24 hours after he did. Moreover, Richardson distinguishes himself from De La Fuente, arguing that while those within the Reform party encouraged him to run, De La Fuente ran at the insistence of ""a partisan Libertarian [Winger] [...] who personally has little interest in the Reform Party's current fortunes or its future"", and who sees the Reform Party as ""just an available ballot line"".
 Richardson's preferred running mate, activist Thomas Knapp, founder of the now-defunct Boston Tea Party, draws an even greater contrast between Richardson and De La Fuente. 
 ""[There were] five states that both Mr. [De La] Fuente [in 2016] and Mr. Richardson [in 2012] appeared on a Democratic primary ballot [in different election cycles] [...],"" explains Knapp, comparing De La Fuente and Richardson's Democratic Party candidacies, ""Richardson outpolled [De La] Fuente and did so on a budget two full orders of magnitude smaller, even though Richardson was running against a popular incumbent president [Barack Obama] and [De La] Fuente was running against one of the most hated politicians in America [Hillary Clinton]."" 
 ""In his presidential campaign so far [De La Fuente] has spent $6.4 million to get 67,000 votes"", Knapp continues. ""That's $95.50 per vote.""
 De La Fuente was asked to respond to these statements and to comment on this report, but he has yet to do so.
 The Reform Party was founded in 1995 by industrialist Ross Perot. Perot ran as the party's first presidential nominee in 1996, and won over eight percent of the popular vote, the highest percentage for a third-party candidate since. In 1998, professional wrestler Jesse Ventura ran on the Reform Party ticket and was elected Governor of Minnesota. The party fell in prominence during the lead-up to the 2000 presidential election when it was plagued by infighting between ideological factions. In 2000, Donald Trump briefly sought the party's presidential nomination, but it was ultimately won by paleoconservative icon Pat Buchanan, who went on to receive only 0.4% of the popular vote in the general election. In 2004, the party opted to endorse consumer advocate Ralph Nader, but ended the year nearly bankrupt. Ted Weill won the party's 2008 presidential nomination, but appeared on the ballot in only one state and won a total of 481 votes. In 2012, the party's presidential nominee, fitness model Andre Barnett, on the ballot only in Florida with write-in status elsewhere, received a total of 952 votes. The party is currently on the ballot in New York and Florida, but, according to Ballot Access News, the New York affiliate is expected to nominate Trump. 
 The party held its 2016 convention the last weekend in July. It had planned to formally announce its presidential ticket on August 8. According to Knapp, Richardson and De La Fuente were the two leading contenders for the nomination. Others seeking the nomination included 2012 vice presidential nominee Kenneth Cross and psychologist Lynn Kahn.
 ""I was approached about entering the contest very recently"", says Richardson. ""I plan to support whatever ticket the party nominates.""
 As Senator Ted Cruz delivered his much-discussed speech before the Republican National Convention, former Congressman Tom Tancredo, an early supporter of Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign, watched with disappointment.  In an exclusive interview with Wikinews, Tancredo argued that Cruz's refusal to endorse Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump during the speech, which prompted what was perhaps one of the most negative crowd reactions to a convention speech in recent memory, was a mistake. 
 ""He needs to realize and appreciate the bigger picture"", said Tancredo about Cruz, ""[y]ou can still hate Donald Trump for the things he says [but] he has to recognize what will happen to the country if the Supreme Court is under the control of Hillary Clinton.""
 Tancredo, who represented Colorado's 6th congressional district from 1999 to 2009, endorsed Cruz in January, writing an op-ed for Breitbart.com in which he touted Cruz as an outsider and ""the real deal."" Tancredo himself ran for president in 2008 as an outsider Republican, focusing on securing the U.S.–Mexico border and enforcing laws against illegal immigration. Notably, during his campaign, Tancredo had a September 2007 interview with Wikinews.
 Cruz's speech affected more than just Tancredo's opinion. Though some praised the speech as principled and politically astute — including Hillary Clinton, who tweeted ""vote your conscience"", repeating what Cruz had said — many prominent Republicans offered rebukes. Former Congressman Joe Walsh called for a Texas Republican to ""primary"" Cruz in 2018, when his Senate seat goes up for re-election, as a consequence for not honoring the GOP endorsement pledge. Chris Christie described Cruz as ""selfish"" for refusing to endorse. Congressman Peter King called Cruz an ""asshole"", a term which RNC spokesman Sean Spicer said was apt. Polls from before and after the speech showed Cruz's approval rating among Republicans fall from 60% to 33%.
 Addressing the backlash, Cruz defended his decision, arguing ""I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father."" Moreover, he claimed the GOP endorsement pledge ""was not a blanket commitment that, if you go and slander and attack Heidi [his wife], that I'm going to nonetheless come like a servile puppy dog and say thank you very much for maligning my wife and my father"".
 The attacks Cruz refers to are Trump's re-tweeting in March of a graphic comparing an unflattering photo of Cruz's wife, Heidi, to a glamour shot of Melania Trump, as well as Trump's mention last May of a National Enquirer report connecting Cruz's father to Lee Harvey Oswald, assassin of President John F. Kennedy.
 Tancredo said he believes the issues facing the nation are ""more important than [Cruz's] personal feelings about his wife or father."" He maintained that Cruz ""could have avoided the problem and 'lived with himself' by passing on the invitation to speak. Apparently the few minutes still in the spotlight was too alluring"".
 A new view on Cruz was not Tancredo's only takeaway from July's convention. He appreciated Trump's acceptance speech as well, calling it the ""[b]est I've heard from him"".
 Before Hillary Clinton's historic moment on the fourth day of the Democratic National Convention, as she became the first woman to accept the presidential nomination of a major US political party, another woman, much younger than Clinton, made history of her own. Sarah McBride, national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), became the first openly transgender person to address a major political party's national convention when she spoke before the Democratic National Convention. Wikinews contacted McBride to find out more about her groundbreaking speech.  
 McBride, a native of Delaware in her mid-20s, came out as a transgender woman during her term at American University as student body president. Before HRC, an LGBT lobbying group, McBride was employed by the Center for American Progress, a progressive advocacy organization, and was the first openly transgender woman to intern at the White House. She currently serves on the Board of Directors for the LGBT activist group Equality Delaware, through which she successfully lobbied the legislature of Delaware to expand the state's anti-discrimination and hate-crimes acts to include gender identity and expression.
 During her convention speech, McBride discussed her relationship with a transgender man, Andrew, who continued LGBT activism despite having terminal cancer. McBride married the man just a few days before his death. McBride's speech received widespread coverage with feature stories from Time Magazine, The Washington Post, Daily Mail, CNN, ABC News, NBC News, Rolling Stone, New York, and others.  
 With Wikinews, McBride discusses the speech, her experience at the convention, and any future political plans.

358," Monday, June 13, 2016 
"," The following is the first edition of a monthly series chronicling the U.S. 2016 presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.
 In this month's edition on the campaign trail: a former Republican congressman briefly joins the Libertarian Party and runs for vice president; the Democratic Party names its National Convention Platform Drafting Committee amid controversy; and Wikinews interviews a candidate who had a surprisingly strong performance in the West Virginia Democratic presidential primary. 
 On the campaign trail in early May, the Republican Party primary race grew more contentious as it reached its final stages.  On the same day as the May 3 Indiana primary, Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who held a sizable delegate lead over his two remaining primary challengers, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich, cited the National Enquirer to accuse Cruz's father of involvement in the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  Cruz, whom Trump branded as ""Lyin' Ted,"" attacked Trump as a ""pathological liar"" and ""serial philanderer.""  Trump won Indiana by a large margin, prompting the second place Cruz to end his campaign.  Thereafter, both the media and Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus christened Trump as the presumptive nominee, even though he had yet to secure the requisite number of National Convention delegates.  The next day, Kasich finally suspended his candidacy.  As Trump pivoted into general election mode, he faced a vocal Stop Trump movement within the party and a significant polling deficit against the Democrats.  A national CNN/ORC poll showed Trump trailing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton by double digits.  Nevertheless, unlike the GOP, the outcome of the Democratic primary race remained undecided.  Although Clinton maintained a significant delegate lead, a CNN poll showed her ahead of sole rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, by only eight points.  In fact, Sanders won the Indiana Democratic primary, making nine victories out of the latest fourteen contests to that point.
 Commencing his general election campaign, Trump announced he would participate in fundraising after self-funding his primary campaign. He named former presidential rival, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson to head a group to search for a running mate.  And, in a show of pro-Hispanic sentiment, he tweeted a photo of himself with a taco bowl on Cinco de Mayo.  Still, the Republican Party remained divided.  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said he would not commit to endorsing Trump.  He called for Trump ""to set aside bullying, [...] belittlement, and appeal to higher aspirations.""  Ryan's comments drew criticism from former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former 2016 presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, among others.  However, former candidates Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, as well as former Presidents George W. Bush and George H. W. Bush, all said they could not support Trump's candidacy.  2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol both called for an independent presidential candidate to run as an alternative to Trump.  Ryan called this ""a disaster,"" and sought unity by inviting Trump to a Republican congressional leadership meeting and offering to step down as chair of the GOP National Convention if Trump so desired.  Despite the internal strife, Trump continued his focus on the general election, branding Clinton as ""crooked Hillary,"" and attacking her for ""want[ing] to abolish the Second Amendment.""  He also pivoted on policies, advocating for a rise in the federal minimum wage and taxes on the wealthy.  The campaign announced that five or six names were on the vice presidential shortlist including former presidential candidate Chris Christie.  Quinnipiac polls showed Trump leading or close behind Clinton in head-to-head match ups in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida.  Clinton won the caucus in Guam and the campaign shifted to West Virginia and Nebraska.  On the eve of the May 10 primaries, Cruz, still on the ballot in Nebraska, announced he might restart his campaign if he won the state. Instead, Trump won Nebraska by a wide margin and won West Virginia by an even wider margin.  On the Democratic side, Sanders won West Virginia as voters turned on Clinton after she expressed unencouraging views about the coal industry.  ABC News exit polling there revealed nearly half of Sanders supporters said they would vote for Trump if Clinton won the nomination.
 Vice President Joe Biden, who had been expected to mount a 2016 campaign until he ruled it out in late 2015, admitted in an interview with ABC that he had planned to run for president in 2016 but the plans derailed upon the death of his son Beau.  He revealed Senator Elizabeth Warren as his preferred running mate and endorsed her for the Democratic vice presidential nomination.  Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada cautioned Democrats against nominating a sitting Senator like Warren to avoid decreasing the number of Democrats in the Senate.  Trump launched an assault on Warren, referring to her as ""goofy"" and Pocahontas for a previous claim of Amerindian ancestry. On May 12, Trump had his much anticipated meeting with Ryan.  Afterwards, the two issued a joint statement calling the meeting ""a very positive step toward unification."" Ryan still withheld his endorsement though Trump asked Ryan to remain as chair of the National Convention. Polls from mid-May showed Trump edging closer to Clinton in national head-to-head match ups, as Trump faced a barrage of controversies. Both Clinton and Romney called on Trump to release his tax records.  He said he might release them, but maintained it was ""none of [the public's] business.""  Media reports also scrutinized Trump for allegedly acting as his own publicist in the early 1990's.  He denied the allegations outright.  Next, The New York Times published an exposé about Trump's treatment of women throughout the years.  The validity of the story came into question when the lead interviewee claimed The Times had taken her account out of context.  On May 17, Trump easily won the Oregon primary.  The next day, for the first time in months, a Fox News poll showed him with a national lead over Clinton.  That same day, he released a list of eleven judges whom he would consider nominating to the U.S. Supreme Court.  He later received an endorsement from the National Rifle Association.  In the Democratic race, Sanders won the Oregon primary and narrowly lost to Clinton in Kentucky.  He was also able to add five of his supporters to the Democratic National Convention platform drafting committee, ensuring greater influence over the party platform.  Clinton rejected a debate with him and announced there would be no further primary debates.  Trump offered to debate Sanders, which Sanders accepted, though Trump later backed out.  Clinton went on the offensive against Trump for his past business bankruptcies, saying he ""could bankrupt America like he's bankrupted his companies.""  She won the Washington primary on May 24.  However, the next day, an Inspector General report said she did not comply with State Department policy when she sent official e-mails on a private server while Secretary of State.
 Following a victory in the Washington Republican primary, Trump traveled to New Mexico, where the sitting Republican governor Susana Martinez snubbed his event.  Trump attacked Martinez during the rally, later asking, ""If I have a Republican that’s not on my side, why should I be particularly nice to that person?""  Shortly thereafter, during a speech in California, he renewed attacks against Romney, Cruz, Kristol, and Jeb Bush.  Former rival Marco Rubio announced he would release the delegates he won during the primary to support Trump and said he would be willing to go on the campaign trail for Trump, if asked.  Rubio also apologized to Trump for derogatory comments he made earlier in the campaign.  Trump mathematically secured the Republican nomination, when an uncommitted slate of delegates in North Dakota committed to supporting him.  Meanwhile, the Libertarian Party commenced its National Convention and nominated for president, on the second ballot, former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson, the party's 2012 presidential nominee.  Also on the second ballot, for vice president, the party nominated Johnson's pre-selected running mate, former Massachusetts Governor William Weld, who had just left the Republican Party to become a Libertarian.  Trump called Johnson a ""fringe candidate.""  Johnson was not the last such candidate introduced in late May.  Seemingly ending his search for an alternative to Trump, Kristol tweeted that he had found an ""impressive"" independent candidate.  Bloomberg reported the candidate was little-known writer David A. French of the National Review.  On the final day of May, Trump held a press conference in which he revealed the veterans charities he donated to after raising $5.6 million during a fundraiser he held in January in lieu of attending a debate.  Trump excoriated the national press for its coverage of his campaign and referred to one reporter as ""sleaze.""  With the June 7 California primary ahead, Clinton received the endorsement of California Governor Jerry Brown.  The latest polls showed her with a two point advantage over Sanders in the state.  In the Real Clear Politics average, she led Trump in the general election nationally by 1.5%.
 As soon as Donald Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination, Libertarian Party (LP) membership applications doubled.  Longtime Republican consultant Mary Matalin, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, and former Congressman Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan, were among those who left the GOP in May to find a new home in the LP.  While Matalin enthusiastically backed Libertarian presidential runner-up Austin Petersen, and Weld won the party's vice presidential nomination; Bentivolio, who had endorsed Dr. Ben Carson for president before joining the party, had a much different experience. 
 ""It was suggested by a few supporters I run [for vice president] as a libertarian,"" says Bentivolio, a teacher and veteran of the Vietnam and Iraq wars, who earned the moniker ""the accidental Congressman"" after his  surprising 2012 election, ""I briefly entertained the idea of running and spent time investigating the party.""
 Bentivolio, 64, unexpectedly won the Republican nomination to represent Michigan's 11th Congressional District in 2012, after the sitting Congressman, Thaddeus McCotter, a 2012 presidential candidate, was unable to run for re-election after his petitions to qualify for the primary ballot were deemed fraudulent.  Upon his victory in the general election, Bentivolio went to Washington, joining the House Committee on Small Business and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.  He took an active role in introducing and sponsoring successful legislation, becoming, according to an historian of the House, one of the most effective freshmen Congressmen of recent times. GovTrack listed him as the most transparent Republican freshman in the 113th United States Congress.  Nevertheless, during his single term, he frequently bucked the party leadership, voting against a resolution to the 2013 government shutdown, calling for the impeachment of President Barack Obama, and agreeing to seek congressional hearings over chemtrails.  In 2014, Bentivolio lost his seat to attorney Dave Trott, a primary opponent with a fundraising edge and the backing of the Republican establishment.  After leaving Congress, Bentivolio suffered financial difficulties and had to file for bankruptcy in 2015, partly the result of his expensive primary campaign against Trott.     
 When Bentivolio joined the LP in May, he filed a Form 2 with the Federal Election Commission to run for vice president.  Libertarian national chairman Nicholas Sarwark encouraged Bentivolio to run for his old congressional seat in addition to vice president.  This was not well received by the local Libertarian Party, which feared such a run would violate Michigan's sore-loser law; the same law that prevented Gary Johnson from appearing on the ballot in 2012.  As a consequence, the local party nominated another candidate to run for the seat.
 ""The district delegates [five in total] voted for another as the House candidate"", recounts Bentivolio, ""[the candidate's] wife was the deciding vote.""
 Afterwards, Bentivolio expressed doubt about the party platform, saying it amounted to ""judicial supremacy,"" which he rejects, referencing the 1857 Dred Scott case, which affirmed the rights of slaveholders.  He added, ""I am 100% pro-life and an abolitionist and many in the Libertarian Party are pro-choice and support slavery in their immigration policy.""  He cited these as his reasons for ending his vice presidential campaign.
 After Gary Johnson and William Weld won the party's presidential and vice presidential nominations at the 2016 Libertarian National Convention, Bentivolio offered his perspective on Johnson and Weld.  Though he considered Johnson, ""a nice guy and honest,"" he felt Johnson ""thinks government has all the answers.""  In contrast, Bentivolio said he personally believes ""government is the problem"" and only supports ""a government within the strict limitations clearly expressed in the Constitution.""  He described Weld, a Council on Foreign Relations member who proposed strict gun control measures as governor, as someone who ""supports big government.""  
 Bentivolio has left the LP and now is an independent.  He remains undecided on whether to support Donald Trump for president.  To help him decide, he is currently researching claims of a woman named ""Katie Johnson"" who filed a lawsuit accusing Trump of rape.  Trump's attorneys dismiss the suit as a hoax.
 Every four years, the Democratic Party holds its National Convention, nominating a presidential ticket and conducting official business.  One important item is the drafting of a party platform to express the party's principles and vision for the future. A special committee is formed to draft the document.  In May, fifteen individuals were named to the committee.  Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz selected four of the members while the two presidential candidates picked the remaining eleven in proportion to the votes each candidate received in the primaries.  Hillary Clinton, the party's presidential front-runner, selected six.  Bernie Sanders chose five, though the DNC rejected one of his original picks, a union leader, leading to charges of anti-union bias in the DNC.  Still, upon the release of the names, The Nation magazine argued Sanders' input provided the committee with a ""progressive majority."" Wikinews was able to reach out to one of Sanders' picks to see what he planned for the platform.
 For the committee, Wasserman Schultz tapped Congressman Elijah Cummings, who is to serve as the head; Congresswoman Barbara Lee, the only returning member from 2012; former Congressman Howard Berman; and Bonnie Schaefer, former Chief Executive Officer of Claire's.  Clinton selected Ambassador Wendy Sherman; Neera Tanden, head of the Center for American Progress; Ohio Representative Alicia Reece; Carol Browner, former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); Congressman Luis Gutiérrez; and union leader Paul Booth.  Sanders picked Dr. Cornel West; Congressman Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to the US Congress; James Zogby, head of the Arab American Institute; Deborah Parker, a Native American activist; and Bill McKibben, a renowned environmentalist.
 McKibben, a Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury College who co-founded the climate change awareness organization 350.org, tells Wikinews that his Vermont roots may explain why Sanders selected him for the committee.  However, McKibben has worked with Sanders previously on climate and energy issues, and The Boston Globe has described him as ""probably the nation’s leading environmentalist.""
 ""I'd like to see [the platform] reflect the fact that since the last election the planet's climate has deteriorated dramatically, with record temperatures, melting ice, and dying coral"", says McKibben, ""So that means we need to move more aggressively, both to cut our reliance on fossil fuels and to boost renewable energy.""  
 McKibben is not the only member who prioritizes environmental issues.  Browner, who headed the EPA during the entire presidency of Bill Clinton, has worked under President Obama as the director of the White House Office of Energy and Climate Change Policy.  While the environment is given a strong emphasis, Sanders has raised the point that labor representation on the committee is lacking.  
 In 2012, union leaders Donna Harris-Aikens of the National Education Association and Thea Lee of the AFL-CIO  were on the committee.  This year, the only union leader is Booth of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.  Sanders attempted to include National Nurses United executive director RoseAnn DeMoro, but Wasserman Schultz vetoed the pick. Sanders, in a press conference, accused the DNC of ""not want[ing] representatives of labor unions on the platform drafting committee.""  The DNC rejected the charge.
 ""We worked carefully with both campaigns to ensure overall balance and representation,"" says DNC spokeswoman April Mellody, ""[we] have 100% confidence that the views of our allies in the Labor community will be well represented in our Party’s platform as they have always been.""
 Amid the division, McKibben expresses hope that though the platform is often ""forgotten not long after it's written,"" perhaps the 2016 platform ""will play a role in uniting the party.""
 The committee is set to convene at the 2016 Democratic National Convention July 25–28 in Philadelphia.
 In the May 10 West Virginia Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton 51.4 percent to 35.8 percent.  Of the remaining 13 percent, nearly nine went to little-known protest candidate Paul T. Farrell Jr., a Huntington, West Virginia attorney who entered the race to challenge President Obama's energy policies.  Wikinews reached out to Farrell to ask a few questions about the campaign.
 During the campaign, Farrell did not hold any fundraisers and his only spending was the $2,500 filing fee to appear on the ballot. He believes Obama's policies, which Clinton supports, have hurt the coal industry, a major sector of West Virginia's economy.  Many West Virginians, even Democrats, share this view.  While mining still makes up 17 percent of West Virginia's gross domestic product (compared to 3 percent nationally), since 2009, coal production has declined around 45 percent in the south part of the state.  332 mines have closed and almost 10,000 jobs or 35 percent of those in the industry, have been lost. West Virginia's unemployment is the worst in the nation.   According to ABC News exit polls from the primary, only 26 percent of West Virginia Democrats want to continue Obama's policies.
 Although registered Democrats outnumber Republicans roughly 577,000 to 378,000 in West Virginia, Republican presidential candidates have won the state in every election since 2000.  ABC exit polls indicate a third of Democrats plan to vote in November for Trump, who has campaigned in favor of the coal industry.  Trump is popular in West Virginia, having won 77 percent in the state's GOP primary.  He holds a 27 point lead over Clinton in the latest Public Policy Polling head-to-head match up.
 West Virginia Democrats have a history of going against the national party establishment.  Notably, prison inmate Keith Russell Judd won 41 percent in the 2012 primary against Obama, who was seeking re-election.  Judd was on the ballot again in 2016, but received only 1.8 percent of the vote.  Judd's 2012 performance was one of the reasons Farrell cited for entered the race.  In addition, he told the Charleston Gazette–Mail back in January that the candidates running did not share ""West Virginia values.""  He had hoped to secure some national convention delegates but just fell short.  He was able to come in second place in the coal-rich Mingo County, where he outpaced Clinton 23.7 percent to 21.4 percent.
 With Wikinews, Farrell discusses, his specific problem with Obama's energy policy, what he is looking for in a presidential candidate, and his views on Trump.

359," Monday, November 2, 2020 
"," The following is the sixth and final edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.
 This month's spotlight on the campaign trail: the Free and Equal Elections Foundation holds two presidential debates, three candidates who did not participate in those debates give their final pleas to voters, and three political pundits give their predictions on the outcome of the election.
 Polls at the start of the final full month on the campaign trail showed Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden leading President Donald Trump, the Republican Party presidential nominee, in the RealClearPolitics average, 50.1 to 42.9 percent.
 October started with a surprise for the electorate. After it was revealed his aide Hope Hicks tested positive for coronavirus, President Trump himself, his wife Melania, and son Barron all tested positive for the virus. Trump was said to be suffering ""minor symptoms"", and was admitted to Walter Reed Hospital as a precaution.  Video captured Trump wearing a mask while walking to Marine One en route to the hospital. Doctors reportedly treated the president with a cocktail of medicines that included an experimental drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals as well as the anti-viral remdesivir and the steroid dexamethasone.  His condition was said to be improving and he posted a four minute long video from the hospital. Supporters gathered outside and Trump made a much-criticized ride to wave at them from the presidential limousine.  After a three day stay, Trump was released from the hospital and returned to the White House.  He tweeted, ""Don't be afraid of Covid. Don’t let it dominate your life."" A couple days after Trump’s release, the only vice presidential debate between Vice President Mike Pence and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris took place in Utah, moderated by USA Today Washington Bureau Chief Susan Page.  Pence often spoke over his allotted time and interjected.  In one exchange, as Pence attempted to interrupt, Harris exclaimed, ""Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking."" A fly landed on Pence's hair for about two minutes. Page received criticism for not asking follow-up questions.  Politico regarded the debate as ""markedly more civil"" than the prior Trump-Biden debate.  The next day, the Commission on Presidential Debates announced its second official presidential debate between Trump and Biden would be virtual due to President Trump's positive COVID-19 test. Trump declined such an arrangement and the Commission canceled the debate.  In its place, Biden scheduled a town hall to air on ABC.  Trump later scheduled a competing town hall on NBC.
 With the Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett looming, the issue of Court packing returned.  Biden and Harris both refused to answer whether they would support Court packing.  Biden said voters ""don't deserve"" to know his position.  A few days later, Biden made another frank comment when he claimed 56 percent of respondents to a Gallup poll, who regarded their personal situation as better now than four years ago, were not remembering correctly, adding people should vote, whatever their beliefs. Still recovering from coronavirus, Trump gave his first speech since the diagnosis from the White House balcony.  Trump's doctors said the President no longer posed a risk of spreading the virus.  Two days later, he returned to the campaign trail with a rally in Sanford, Florida.  At the rally, Trump declared himself ""immune"" and offered to kiss members of the crowd.  White House doctors said Trump tested negative for COVID-19 for two consecutive days.
 In another potential ""October surprise,"" on the week of Trump and Biden's dueling town halls, the New York Post published an article about the discovery of a laptop belonging to Biden's son Hunter that he allegedly abandoned at a Delaware computer repair shop.  According to the Post, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon told them of its existence and current Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City, recently gave them a copy of its harddrive's contents allegedly obtained from the shop owner.  E-mails in the copy detailed Hunter's worldwide business affairs and alleged influence peddling.  Contrary to the elder Biden's assurances he had no involvement in his son's business deals, an e-mail alluded to a 2015 meeting between the elder Biden and a Ukranian adviser to the board of the energy company Burisma, on which Hunter served. The report claimed after the meeting the elder Biden used his influence as vice president to have a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating Burisma fired.  The material also contained a video of Hunter smoking crack cocaine and taking part in a sex act.  Fifty former intelligence officials, including former CIA directors John Brennan, Leon Panetta, and Michael Hayden, signed a letter saying the Post'‍s report ""has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.""  Current Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said the information was ""not part of some Russian disinformation campaign."" According to The Washington Post, intelligence officials warned the administration last December that Giuliani could be a conduit for Russian disinformation. Twitter prevented users from sharing the Post story, claiming it violated their policy on hacked materials.  Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey later said they made a mistake. Facebook did not censor the story but limited its spread on their platform.  Shortly after the report, Trump and Biden held the dueling town halls on NBC and ABC, respectively.  While NBC simulcast Trump's hour long town hall, hosted by Savannah Guthrie, on the main network as well as MSNBC and CNBC, ABC broadcast Biden's town hall with George Stephanopoulos for two hours.  The broadcast of Biden's event received more viewers than Trump's event. At his town hall, which newspaper The Hill described as combative, Trump refused to disavow the Qanon conspiracy theory and defended his pandemic policies.  At Biden's event, Biden implied he would consider making a potential COVID-19 vaccine mandatory.  On Court packing, he said his decision would depend on how the Senate conducts the Barrett confirmation hearing.
 The Commission on Presidential Debates announced the moderator for the third debate would have a mute button to prevent interruptions during the first two minute candidate responses with each question.  Biden left the campaign trail to prepare for the debate.  Trump did minimal preparation, holding rallies instead.  At this time, he made critical remarks about National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci and posted footage on Twitter from a soon-to-be released 60 Minutes interview with Leslie Stahl, that Trump claimed was unfair.  Trump's previous debate prepper Giuliani received further media scrutiny when he appeared in the Borat Subsequent Moviefilm.  In a scene, Giuliani goes into a hotel bedroom, where a hidden camera records him lying on a bed with his hands in his pants in the company of a young actress posing as a conservative journalist. Giuliani claimed he was tucking in his shirt after removing his microphone and suggested Borat actor and producer Sacha Baron Cohen may have deceptively edited the footage. Giuliani received news concerning the laptop harddrive data in his possession: Fox News reported two separate law enforcement sources confirmed an FBI money laundering probe connected to the laptop.  Additionally, Ratcliffe and FBI director Christopher Wray held a press conference discussing concerns about Iranian and Russian interference in the election.  Ratcliffe claimed Iran spoofed e-mails to spread false information about voting to hurt President Trump's chances of re-election.  Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon predicted Trump would run for president again in 2024 if he lost in 2020.  Democrats continued to attack Trump on his taxes. Senator Bernie Sanders slammed Trump for a New York Times story alleging Trump paid more taxes to the Chinese and other governments than to the United States.  
 Just before the final presidential debate, Hunter Biden's former business partner Tony Bobulinski held a press conference claiming Joe Biden knew about his son's business deals, particularly with China, and that the elder Biden was involved with them.  He claimed to have evidence supporting the claim. The issue came up at the Nashville, Tennessee-set second presidential debate, moderated by Kristen Welker of NBC News.  Biden denied the allegations, labeled them as Russian disinformation.  Echoing an email from Hunter Biden's laptop referencing a mysterious ""big guy"" who received a cut of money, Trump said, ""You're the big man, I think.""  Trump attacked Biden for accumulating wealth since leaving public office, accusing the Biden family of going around the world and sucking up money like a vacuum.  Biden slammed Trump, viewing the president as having no plan to combat COVID-19.  Trump said he banned travel from China in January, which Biden opposed as xenophobic.  He claimed a vaccine was near and said people are ""learning to live"" with the virus.  Biden countered that people are instead ""learning to die"" with it. Biden argued that Trump had no healthcare plan.  He proposed a public option and claimed nobody lost their health insurance as a result of Obamacare.  Trump alleged Biden's plan would strip Medicare and Social Security.  He vowed to protect people with pre-existing conditions from being denied health coverage. When asked about climate change, Trump claimed carbon emissions have been lower during his administration and argued against re-entering the Paris Climate Accord. Biden argued that green energy can provide good paying jobs. Trump accused Biden of previously saying he wanted to ban hydraulic fracturing. Biden denied, though Trump said it is on tape.  Biden asked Trump to post the video on his website.  Welker brought up the separation of immigrant families at the border.  Trump point out the Obama administration constructed the cages seen in widely circulated photos taken in 2014. Trump blasted Biden as a career politician and repeatedly asked why Biden did not already implement the policies he proposed. Biden attacked Trump on paying fewer taxes to which Trump claimed he prepaid ""millions of dollars"" in taxes. Trump cornered Biden on oil and gas when Biden admitted wanting to phase out the industry. Trump said Biden just lost Texas, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and Ohio as a consequence.  Welker received near-universal praise for her performance.  Observers noted the debate was more orderly than the first.
 In the final days of October, Trump ramped up his campaign, holding up to five rallies a day  throughout such states as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, Arizona, and Florida, among others. Biden limited campaigning but still made stops in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, and others.  Due to COVID-19, attendees to Biden events were required to socially distance or to stay in their automobiles with horns in the place of applause.  At one Biden rally in Pennsylvania, Trump supporters audibly chanted slogans nearby.  Biden referred to the people as ""chumps.""  At another in Minnesota, Biden referred to hecklers as ""ugly folks.""  Meanwhile, a series of news events broke as Election Day drew closer.  The Senate confirmed judge Barrett to the Supreme Court.  Justice Clarence Thomas swore her in at a White House ceremony with Trump looking on.  The White House also announced a deal it brokered to normalize relations between Sudan and Israel.  This followed deals the administration brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Kosovo, in recent months.  The fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., a mentally ill African American man armed with a knife, sparked riots and looting in Philadelphia. Biden-Harris released a statement: ""[w]e cannot accept that in this country a mental health crisis ends in death.""  President Trump called it a ""terrible event"" but urged for the National Guard to be brought in to end the violence.  Category Two Hurricane Zeta slammed into the Louisiana coast.  Winds from the storm delayed a rally Trump planned for North Carolina.  The anonymous insider who wrote New York Times op-eds and a book critical of the Trump administration was revealed to be former Department of Homeland Security chief of staff Miles Taylor.  The Trump campaign described Taylor as ""just another standard-issue arrogant, Washington, DC swamp bro who loved President Trump until he figured out he could try to make money by attacking him"". The Commerce department released a report showing growth in GDP of 33.1 percent in the third quarter of 2020.  This was the largest growth for the nation in a quarter since World War II, topping the record of 16.7 percent in the first quarter of 1950.  Trump hailed the report on Twitter and warned that Biden could destroy the growth with his proposed tax increases.  Biden described the growth as not ""nearly enough.""
 At the end of October, President Trump trailed former Vice President Biden in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head matchup, 51.3 to 43.5 percent.
 The Free and Equal Elections Foundation held two debates in October, attracting third party and independent candidates.  The criterion for inclusion was ballot access in at least eight states.  The two major party candidates qualified but were barred from participating due to the contracts they signed with the Commission on Presidential Debates.   Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, Alliance Party presidential nominee Rocky De La Fuente, and rapper Kanye West were each invited but did not attend.  Those who did take part in-person were: Independent presidential candidate Brock Pierce, Green Party presidential nominee Howie Hawkins, Constitution Party presidential nominee Don Blankenship, American Solidarity Party presidential nominee Brian Carroll, and Party for Socialism and Liberation presidential nominee Gloria La Riva.  All of these candidates also confirmed for the final debate, but Blankenship ultimately decided not to attend. Free and Equal Elections Foundation founder and director Christina Tobin moderated both debates. This was the fourth election cycle the foundation has held a debate.  The debates used the format the League of Women voters developed when  they held the official presidential debates before the creation of the Commission on Presidential Debates.
 At the initial debate, held October 8 in Denver, Colorado, after opening statements, the candidates received a total of 13 questions on the War in Afghanistan, approval and rank choice voting, national debate reform, the surveillance state, space warfare, indigenous rights, police reform, education reform, Yemen, the War on Drugs, vaccinations, gun rights, and excessive imprisonment. Questioners included Tobin, anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan, Aaron Hamlin of The Center for Election Science, Eli Beckerman of Open the Debates, actor Sean Stone, SpaceX co-founder Jim Cantrell, indigenous leader Doug Good Feather, and the mother of prisoner  Ross Ulbricht.  The debate closed with final statements from each candidate.
 In opening the debate, Carroll introduced himself as ""pro-life"" and said climate change must be addressed.  Pierce derided the two party system and argued it cannot resolve the nation's problems. La Riva blamed capitalism as the root of all the nation's ills.  Blankenship offered US$1 million to Hunter Biden to have a debate with Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and made the same offer available to President Donald Trump. And Hawkins, the only candidate wearing a facemask, endorsed the Green New Deal and the Economic Bill of Rights.  
 The candidates agreed on many issues with varied nuances. All supported the removal of US troops from Afghanistan though Pierce and Carroll raised concerns about the problems that  could arise from a hasty withdrawal.  While La Riva and Hawkins attacked war as a tool of the US ruling class, Blankenship wanted the US to avoid being the policeman of the world.  Blankenship described efforts toward approval or rank choice voting as too complicated and ""diluting"" efforts toward ballot access. All the other candidates favored rank choice voting.  La Riva favored offering voting rights to documented and undocumented immigrants, prisoners, and youths aged 16 to 18 years.  Most candidates felt the League of Women Voters did a better job holding debates than the Commission on Presidential Debates, agreeing the sponsor should be nonpartisan. Pierce commented on the unfairness of ""rigged polls"" excluding third party candidates. Blankenship attacked the media for maintaining the status quo, providing an example of the media falsely describing him as a ""felon"" ahead of the 2018 West Virginia Republican Senate primary. Blankenship favored expanding space exploration, arguing the US should be at the lead rather than some other nation. La Riva criticized any space agency as militaristic.  Most candidates agreed to the need of an international body to regulate space. On Police reform, Blankenship and Carroll expressed opposition to Defund the Police while La Riva fully endorsed it, Hawkins expressed an interest in community control of the police, and Pierce focused on providing further training for officers.  Pierce and Carroll endorsed charter schools, though Carroll expressed concerns about for-profit schools. Hawkins said many charter schools were scams.  La Riva said she fully opposed charter schools. Pierce called for an end to the War on Drugs, with which Hawkins and La Riva somewhat agreed. La Riva agreed and favored prosecuting banks for providing funds and said legalization would not be helpful, cautioning about the dangers of pharmaceuticals.  Hawkins called for the decriminalization of drugs like Portugal but felt those exploiting others should be prosecuted. He favored providing medical access for addicts.  Blankenship opposed ending the War on Drugs but said those at the top should be prosecuting rather than users.  Carroll agreed and cautioned about the effect of cannabis use on the brain. La Riva, Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all agreed that vaccines have done more good than harm.  Hawkins, Blankenship, and Carroll all argued they should not be mandatory. Pierce said he would not take a vaccine for COVID-19, claiming it alters the recipient's RNA and turns them into ""genetically modified humans.""  Carroll and La Riva disagreed about whether a clinic in San Francisco was selling the body parts of aborted fetuses.  La Riva said she fully supports abortion rights.  On the issue of guns, Pierce expressed concern about the number of US citizens purchasing guns and warned of an impending civil war.
 In closing, Pierce urged voters to ""vote their conscience."" La Riva argued that only socialism can bring about equality to the nation.  Blankenship claimed he was the only candidate on the stage who based his platform on the US Constitution and called for the use of cost-benefit analysis for policy.  Hawkins predicted President Trump would lose in a massive landslide and asked voters to vote for what they truly believe. Carroll demanded the protection of human dignity and support for the family as society's basic unit.
 At the final debate held October 24 in Cheyenne, Wyoming, after opening statements, the candidates received ten questions on fairness in debates, veteran suicides, military propaganda, centralized control of technology, national sovereignty, the primary system, rank choice voting, ballot access laws, regulation of artificial intelligence, and the national debt. Chad  Peace of the Independent Voters Network, antiwar activist Adam Kokesh, Brian Anderson of Nexus, conspiracy theorist G. Edward Griffin, Kaia Los Huertos of the National Association of Nonpartisan Reformers, Renaldo Pearson of RepresentUS, Richard Winger of Ballot Access News, and Tobin, each asked questions. Like the previous, the debate concluded with final statements from the candidates.
 With Blankenship's absence, only four candidates took the stage.  In opening, La Riva called for an end to the capitalist system, and the cancellation of all rents and mortgages.  Pierce professed himself ""deeply concerned"" about the future of the US and endorsed using ""life"", ""liberty"", and ""happiness"" as the measure of success.  Hawkins renewed his support for the Green New Deal and an Economic Bill of Rights, and added a call for the abolition of nuclear weapons.  He noted that the doomsday clock is very close to midnight. Carroll argued that the US has the strength necessary to overcome all the problems it faces.  He found it curious he was called a ""Democratic socialist"" in one publication and yet received the endorsement of a writer for The American Conservative.
 Like the previous debate, there was much agreement among the candidates. Pierce and Hawkins both argued for using ballot access as an inclusion standard for debates.  La Riva disagreed, stating that the Electoral College should be eliminated. She criticized the Top Two election policy in California and called for the Citizens United decision to be overturned. Carroll also backed the overturn of Citizens United.  Hawkins attacked the ""macho culture"" that idolizes the military while it fights to protect the interests of the upper class. Carroll recalled someone who went to fight in the Vietnam War and returned changed. He wondered how the US can train people to be racist killers and then expect them to return to society. La Riva described the military as a ""horrible"" use of the working class.  She called the Korean War a ""genocidal war.""  Pierce then explained he was an honorary ambassador in Korea.  He longed for the reopening of the border between North and South Korea.  Pierce emphasized big tech censorship as a problem more than military propaganda. He argued that tech companies should either decide to be publishers or platforms. La Riva regarded technology under capitalism as problematic but said it would be beneficial under socialism. Pierce countered that technology is amoral and can be good or bad based on how it is used.  Hawkins argued that big tech is moving the nation in a democratic socialist direction.  Carroll argued for checks and balances for big tech and for a new level of government to regulate big tech.  La Riva then called for the expropriation of big tech companies and to let the US people decide how to use the parts.  Concerning national sovereignty, Pierce said he favored treaties over war and endorsed an audit of the Federal Reserve.  Hawkins called for the nationalization of the Federal Reserve and expressed concern about the nation losing its sovereignty to corporations rather than other nations. La Riva agreed with the nationalization of the Federal Reserve.  Carroll argued that trade deals like NAFTA have unforeseen consequences like pushing Mexican corn growers north of the border. Carroll also said he wanted to edit the 14th Amendment to remove corporations from its protection.  Whereas Pierce and Hawkins all felt parties should decide the procedures for their own primaries, La Riva favored the open primary system, arguing it is more democratic than Top Two.  Pierce claimed Abraham Lincoln was the last third party candidate to be elected president and that he appointed a cabinet of rivals.  Pierce said he was embarrassed about the questions politicians asked to tech leaders, and argued the nation needs ""visionary leadership.""  La Riva argued against Universal Basic Income (UBI), proposing minimum wage be increased to US$20 an hour.  Carroll agreed with La Riva, saying that jobs are more important than UBI.  He named his economic view as distributism, which he said was an extreme form of capitalism.  Hawkins claimed that as a currency issuers rather than a currency user, the US government has enough money to spend and that the debt and deficit does not matter. La Riva agreed, claiming there was enough wealth in the nation to pay for everyone's needs. Carroll called on the US to end its involvement in foreign wars worldwide and to stop paying for wars on a credit card.  Pierce viewed the debt as an issue and that government has run out of control and tax reform is necessary.
 In conclusion, Carroll explained that he is pro-life on all issues. He supported social justice and considered strong local  communities, strong small businesses, and strong families as fundamental. La Riva argued socialism is growing in popularity and private ownership is the real tyranny people live under.  Pierce emphasized the need for education across the nation and likened the current system to indoctrination.  Hawkins claimed the coronavirus pandemic shows the US is a ""failed state.""  He urged voters to vote for what they want.
 Wikinews provided an opportunity for three presidential candidates who did not participate in either of the Free and Equal Election debates to give their final plea to voters.  Those giving their final pleas are: Libertarian Party presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen, Prohibition Party presidential nominee Phil Collins, and Unity Party of America presidential nominee Bill Hammons.
 I'm counting on my libertarian and independent base because they know that I'm the real deal. 
 To dissatisfied Democrats stuck with a candidate who voted for more war and who wrote some of our most oppressive criminal justice laws, I say, ""There is a real party of peace and justice."" The party that selects the author of draconian incarceration and a prosecutor who locked up thousands for victimless crime does not deserve your vote. To them, I say, ""Be Bold. Vote Gold.""
 To small-government Republicans who've watched out-of-control spending and fiat money creation, who rightly fear Venezuela-style inflation and economic collapse, I say, ""There is a real party of smaller government and individual responsibility."" We can unshackle the market to create prosperity and opportunity, and we can reduce government by 75% without leaving anyone out in the cold. To fiscal conservatives, I say, ""Be Bold. Vote Gold.""
 My final plea is telling voters that I remind people about the harmful effects of alcohol.  I tell them that we care about other issues.  We support a balanced budget.  We're pro-life and pro-gun rights.
 It is highly possible that this election will be the first to be thrown to the House of Representatives in the modern era.  The 12th Amendment outlines that the top three finishers in the Electoral College receive consideration for a House vote, and I would just need a handful of (or perhaps even just one) Electoral Vote(s) to be in the final running alongside two men who, not to put too fine a point on it, are walking National Security risks considering their health, age, and risk factors for a raging COVID-19 Pandemic.  I ask voters to vote their conscience, because Presidential Electors are people too, and enough Hammons votes might convince enough Electors to also vote their conscience.
 Wikinews asked three political pundits to give their predictions for the Electoral college tally of the 2020 presidential election.  The pundits were: former U.S. Congressman Tom Tancredo, who represented Colorado's 6th congressional district as a Republican; political blogger Thomas Knapp, who founded the |Boston Tea Party; and attorney Ron Gunzburger, founder and publisher of the elections website Politics1.com. 
 In addition to his time in Congress, Tancredo ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party's 2008 presidential nomination.  During his run he spoke to Wikinews in an exclusive interview.  Afterwards, Tancredo ran for Governor of Colorado in 2010 as the nominee of the Constitution Party, finishing the race in second place.  He later returned to the Republican Party.
 Tancredo predicts President Trump wins re-election over former Vice President Biden with an electoral count of 362 to 176.
 In 2008, Knapp stood as the first vice presidential nominee of the Boston Tea Party, which disbanded in 2012.  Historian Darcy Richardson picked Knapp as his running mate for his 2016 campaign for the Reform Party's presidential nomination.  Knapp runs the politics blog KN@PPSTER and is the director and senior news analyst of The William Lloyd Garrison Center for Libertarian Advocacy Journalism.
 Knapp predicts former Vice President Biden defeats President Trump with an electoral count of 319 to 219.
 Gunzburger, a trial lawyer since 1988, founded the nonpartisan Politics1.com in 1997.  He currently serves as senior advisor to Maryland's Republican Governor Larry Hogan.  According to Twitter, he describes himself as a centrist Democrat.
 Gunzburger predicts former Vice President Biden defeats President Trump with an electoral count of 359 to 179.
 
 
","https://en.wikinews.org//wiki/On_the_campaign_trail_in_the_USA,_October_2020"
360," Thursday, October 29, 2020 "," The following is the fifth edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.
 This month's spotlight on the campaign trail: the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee secures ballot access in all 50 U.S. states, the Unity Party of America presidential nominee proposes a novel solution to the issue of ""packing"" the U.S. Supreme Court, and three candidates give their thoughts on the latest military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
 As the campaign entered September, Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden led President Donald Trump, the Republican Party presidential nominee, in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.0 percent to 43.0 percent.
 President Trump started the month visiting Kenosha, Wisconsin, where riots had broken out due to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in August.  Trump referred to the riots as acts of ""domestic terror"" and placed further emphasis on maintaining ""law and order."" His opponent, Biden, in a message to fundraisers, accused Trump of ""trying to scare the hell out of America.""  Biden himself visited Kenosha two days after Trump in what was his first campaign trip to the swing state of Wisconsin.  During the appearance, Biden delivered a speech on racial inequality while wearing a mask, discussing the ""original sin"" of slavery.  He also visited the family of Jacob Blake and spoke to Blake on the phone.  The Trump campaign criticized Biden for not denouncing Antifa and for making the trip despite claiming previously that it was not safe to do so due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Wisconsin governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, said he would have preferred that neither Trump nor Biden had made the stop. At least three unfavorable claims about Trump surfaced in early September.  First, after CNN reporter and former Bill Clinton White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart questioned whether the President's impromptu visit to Walter Reed Hospital last November was the result of a stroke, Trump alleged the media was falsely claiming he had suffered from ""mini-strokes.""  Thereafter, Matt Drudge posted a report from The Hill about Trump's ""mini-strokes"" tweet as the top story on the Drudge Report. Trump attacked Drudge as a consistent Trump opponent and his campaign called for CNN to fire Lockhart.  Next, The Atlantic claimed that during a 2018 trip to France, Trump refused to visit a cemetery of U.S. soldiers killed during the World War I Battle of Belleau Wood and referred to the soldiers buried there as ""losers"" and ""suckers.""  Furthermore, Trump allegedly questioned whether the U.S. allied with the correct side during the war.  Aides publicly denied the story as did Trump-critic and former National Security Advisor John Bolton.  Nevertheless, others, including Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin, confirmed key parts of the story.  Trump called on Fox News to fire Griffin. Lastly, excerpts from Bob Woodward's book Rage, for which Trump gave insider access, revealed Trump downplayed the coronavirus in February in order to avoid public panic.  Trump confirmed the claim, arguing it was not in the national interest to stir up panic about the virus.   Biden, while campaigning in Michigan, called Trump's action ""a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.""  He described it as ""beyond despicable"" and ""almost criminal."" 
Trump stirred controversy for himself both during an interview with a local Wilmington, North Carolina outlet and again at a rally in Pennsylvania.  He suggested supporters fill out absentee ballots, and then visit their polling places and vote in-person if records indicated they had not voted. After Trump tweeted the same advice, Twitter placed a warning over the tweet. People in the Trump administration and campaign said his comments were misconstrued and that he did not support voting twice. According to the North Carolina State Board of Elections, voting twice is a felony.
 In mid-September, Trump held his first indoor rally in three months, in Nevada, flouting local coronavirus mandates.  Afterwards Trump visited California to discuss the wildfires wreaking havoc in the state.  In a public briefing that included California governor Gavin Newsom, Trump denied the effect of climate change on the intensity of the fires, arguing they were largely the product of forest mismanagement.  The climate change issue reappeared on the campaign trail.  Biden delivered a speech in Delaware in which he called Trump a ""climate arsonist,"" citing the recent California wildfires, flooding and Atlantic hurricanes.  He argued that if Trump wins re-election, ""these hellish events will continue to become more common."" In Florida, where hurricanes have a disproportionate impact, polls revealed Trump strengthening with Latinos; perhaps due, League of United Latin American Citizens president Domingo Garcia indicated, to Trump's social conservative positions and stances against socialism and protests.  As Kamala Harris visited the state and focused more on the African American constituency, Biden campaign officials expressed concern about Latino support.  Biden improved his standing among another large voting bloc in Florida, senior citizens, who voted heavily for Trump in 2016.  Furthermore, a major boost for Biden in Florida came with the announcement that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg planned to invest US$100 million into the state and offered to pay fines for former inmates to regain their ability to vote. Trump claimed the move was criminal. 
 Building on the deal brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the previous month, the Trump administration announced additional deals between Israel and Bahrain and between Serbia, Kosovo, and Israel.  Like the UAE, the Muslim majority nations of Bahrain and Kosovo recognized Israel and opened diplomatic relations with the nation. The formerly antagonistic nations of Serbia and Kosovo opened economic ties as well and Serbia agreed to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Representatives from the UAE, Bahrain, and Israel held a special signing at the White House with President Trump.  Trump hailed the agreements as the ""dawn of a new Middle East.""  Meanwhile, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region escalated to violence. Back home, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, leaving an opening on the Court.  Democrats claimed the election should decide who picks the next justice, citing the Republicans' refusal to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland after the death of Antonin Scalia in 2016.  Republicans argued this was a different situation than in 2016 because now the party controlling the Senate matches the President's party.  President Trump nominated Federal Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the seat.  Citing concerns Barrett's placement would upset the balance of the Court for conservatives, some Democrats advocated packing the Court with liberal justices until it reached a liberal majority.  That would only be possible if Democrats won the presidency and the Senate.  When confronted with the possibility of Democrats winning the election, Trump would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power, claiming the possibility of fraud occurring as a result of increased mail-in voting. Trump received criticism for the statement.  Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a sometime Trump critic, said the peaceful transfer of power is what separates the U.S. from nations like Belarus, and described Trump's potential unwillingness as ""unthinkable and unacceptable."" The Biden campaign recycled a statement it first put out in July:  ""The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House."" Trump received further criticism just ahead of the first presidential debate,  when The New York Times published allegations about his tax returns.  The reports indicated Trump paid US$750 in taxes in 2016 and the same amount in 2017, and that he owed on loans in excess of US$300 million due in four years.  Trump labeled the report as ""fake news"" and said he would release his tax returns once he was no longer under audit.  Biden left the campaign trail a few days before the debate to prepare both virtually and in-person at his Delaware house. According to CNN, a source told them Trump prepared for a total of two hours, enlisting help from former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  He continued to hold campaign rallies and White House events.
 The first presidential debate between Trump and Biden took place on the penultimate day of September in Ohio. During the debate, the candidates often interrupted each other.  Although Biden was the first to do so, Trump interrupted far more often.  Moderator Chris Wallace was criticized for his inability to maintain control. During the debate, Biden would not say whether or not he supported Court packing.  Once, when Trump interjected, Biden said ""Will you Shut up, man?""  During the course of the debate, Biden called Trump a clown, a racist, and the worst president.  Trump insulted Biden as unintelligent. After Biden attacked Trump for the alleged ""losers"" and ""suckers"" comment reported in The Atlantic, Trump brought up Biden's son Hunter Biden and his dealings in Ukraine and China.  Biden defended his son's struggle with drugs. Biden attacked Trump for the over 200,000 U.S. deaths from coronavirus. Trump countered that Biden would have lost even more if he were president due to his opposition to the travel ban from China. Trump claimed Democrats pushed Biden to the far left on socialized medicine, the Green New Deal and defunding the Police. Biden referred to himself as the Democratic Party and said he did not support the policies Trump mentioned. Trump argued Biden had just lost the far left by saying he didn't support those things.  He challenged Biden to name any law enforcement individuals or groups who endorsed Biden's campaign, which Biden did not do. Trump made a confusing statement about the far right organization Proud Boys, when asked to condemn them, stating ""stand back and stand by"" but argued the far left Antifa organization needed to be addressed.  Biden called Antifa an ""idea.""  Trump continued his claims about postal voting causing fraud and again would not commit to accepting the results of the election. After the debate, CNN anchor Dana Bash described the event as a ""shitshow."" Republican Senator Ben Sasse had the same response. Fox News commentator Ari Fleischer called it ""a mess.""  Biden called Trump a ""national embarrassment"" for his performance, while the communications director for the Trump campaign, Tim Murtaugh, declared victory for Trump.  According to the Commission on Presidential Debates, moderators would have ""additional tools"" to maintain order in future debates.
 As September came to a close, Biden maintained his lead over President Trump in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.7 percent to 43.1 percent.
 Libertarian Party presidential candidate Jo Jorgensen passed a milestone in September, becoming the only third party candidate in this election to secure ballot access in all states and the District of Columbia.  The party had the same access in 2016, but in that cycle there was no coronavirus pandemic hampering petitioning efforts.  Before 2016, the last time the Libertarian Party had ballot access in all jurisdictions was 1996 when Jorgensen was on the ballot as the running mate of the late Harry Browne.  The Browne-Jorgensen ticket, as well as the Reform Party ticket of the late Ross Perot that same year, was the last time before 2016 that any third party or independent candidate achieved full ballot access.
 In a celebratory email to supporters, Jorgensen exclaimed: ""It's official — my campaign is on ballot in ALL 50 states!  I want to thank all the volunteers and staff who made this possible. It was a lot of work! We're talking about hours upon hours of collecting petitions.""
 With the access secured, Jorgensen aimed to gain entry to the presidential debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.  The Commission's  criterion for inclusion remains a showing of 15 percent support in opinion polls.  In late September polls, when included, Jorgensen was in third place.  She drew two percent in the September 25–27 Léger poll, two percent in the September 26–27 Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey, and five percent in the September 25–27 Zogby Analytics poll.
 ""We are the real choice for American voters in November,"" Jorgensen argued, ""yet the corrupt Commission on Presidential Debates refuses to have me. Our campaign is the only viable option to both Trump or Biden.""
 In 2016, despite full ballot access and a lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates, then-Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson was denied access to the debates.  Nevertheless, he received 3.27 percent of the vote on Election Day, the most a Libertarian Party presidential nominee has ever received.
 In mid-September, staunch liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died after a long battle with cancer.  President Trump nominated conservative Amy Coney Barrett as her replacement.  With a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate, Barrett's confirmation was likely, resulting a 6–3 majority for conservatives in the Court.  In response, some Democrats, such as former 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, proposed major changes to the Court, similar to what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed in the 1930s.  While Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden did not say in the debate whether he supports significant changes, one third party presidential nominee proposed to Wikinews a novel approach, aiming both to prevent future Court packing and promote ideological balance.
 After his New Deal programs suffered a series of defeats in the Supreme Court, President Roosevelt looked to add justices that would interpret the Constitution to uphold his agenda.  Capitalizing on the public perception of the Court as being too old, Roosevelt sought to tie the number of justices to age. In 1937, he proposed a bill to amend the Judiciary Act of 1869, which sets the number of Supreme Court justices at nine.
Roosevelt's bill would allow the President to nominate one additional justice for every justice over the age of 70 years and six months with at least ten years of experience on the bench.  The proposal capped the number of justices to be nominated this way at six.  The plan did not receive much support, even from his own Democratic Party.  The Senate voted 70 to 20 to send the bill back to committee, where it died.
 Now, 83 years later, some Democrats have revisited a plan to expand the number of justices that Buttigieg proposed during his campaign.  He suggested expanding the Court to 15 justices: five Republicans, five Democrats, and five to be chosen by the other justices. Other Democratic plans include a straight-up expansion of the number of justices and a plan to institute term limits for justices.  According to a 2019 Marquette University poll, 57 percent of the U.S. public opposes expanding the number of justices. However, 72 percent support term limits.
 Bill Hammons, 2020 presidential nominee of the Unity Party of America, whose running mate Eric Bodenstab spoke to Wikinews in August, provided Wikinews with his own plan for the Court.  While it would expand the number of justices, it aims to prevent future Court packing:
 ""The number of Justices should be set at 13 with a Constitutional Amendment to prevent future Court Packing,"" says Hammons, ""and the four new Justices should be smart non-ideologues who have been ignored for their lack of ideology.""
 The U.S. Constitution provides two ways to propose a Constitutional Amendment as Hammons proposes: (1) a two-thirds affirmative vote in the Senate and House of Representatives, or (2) an affirmative vote in the state legislatures of two-thirds of the states to call a constitutional convention.  The latter route has not yet been used. If an amendment is successfully proposed, three-quarters of states must then ratify it in order for the amendment to become part of the Constitution.  The last successful amendment occurred in 1992.
 While both the Hammons plan and the Buttigieg plan aim for balance, Hammons's approach differs from Buttigieg's in that future Court packing, like that proposed from President Roosevelt, would not be possible absent further amendment to the Constitution.  Furthermore, there is no partisan classification of justices provided and party identification does not serve as the basis for judicial ideology. Curiously, the number of justices Hammons favors matches the current number of U.S. circuit courts; the courts from which the Supreme Court hears appeals.
 A longstanding conflict between the nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan erupted into violence late in September.  The conflict between the two Post-Soviet states centers on the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  It lies within the internationally-recognized borders of Azerbaijan but the Armenian-backed separatist Republic of Artsakh currently occupies it. After inquiry from Wikinews, U.S. presidential candidates Phil Collins of the Prohibition Party, Don Blankenship of the Constitution Party, and Jo Jorgensen of the Libertarian Party, weighed in on the issue.
 Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a war over the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 1994.   Russia brokered a cease-fire agreement but skirmishes continued to break out.  The latest violence began with conflicting claims from both sides. The Armenians claim they were retaliating against missile attacks from Azerbaijan.  The Azerbaijanis state they were responding to Armenian aggression.  The president of Turkey vowed support for Azerbaijan, while Russia called for a cessation of fighting.  As of September 30, Armenia claimed 790 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed, with 103 Artsakh deaths. Azerbaijan claimed to have killed about 2,300 Artsakh soldiers.
 President Trump commented on the matter during a White House Press Briefing, ""[W]e're looking at it very strongly. [...] We have a lot of good relationships in that area. We'll see if we can stop it.""  Although Trump's State Department asked for any ""external party"" not to involve themselves in the conflict, his main presidential rival Joe Biden called on the President to demand directly that Turkey stop interfering on Azerbaijan's behalf.
 Collins saw compromise as the best way for the two nations to resolve their differences: ""I think that those countries should compromise and split the disputed area in half."" Nevertheless, Collins did not want the U.S. to involve itself militarily and calls on Washington to remain neutral. His opponents, Jorgensen and Blankenship, shared this view.
 ""The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan is their conflict. Not ours"", said Jorgensen. ""We have no business taking either side. Our foreign policy should resemble one giant Switzerland, armed and neutral.""
 Blankenship concurred: ""We need to stop policing the world and allow other countries to manage their own affairs"", he argued. ""We need to withdraw our troops from all but a very few foreign countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan should be given the freedom to solve their own issues. "" 
 There is precedent for the U.S. President mediating international disputes. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt mediated a peace agreement between Japan and Russia, fostering the treaty that ended the Russo-Japanese War.  Roosevelt's efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize.  President Jimmy Carter mediated an end to the conflict between Israel and Egypt at the Camp David Accords in 1978 that brought about the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty and the normalization of relations between the two nations.  The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited this in awarding Carter the 2002 Peace Prize.  And President Trump, in September 2020, addressed the Arab–Israeli conflict in mediating the Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.

"," A report released by the US House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform today found that the White House had ""used the political affairs office to orchestrate an aggressive strategy to use taxpayer-funded trips to help elect Republican candidates"" during the 2006 Congressional elections. The actions of the White House may have breached the Hatch Act, which prohibits government involvement with taxpayer dollars in political affairs.
 The Office of Political Affairs coordinated the efforts, and while it has been used in the past to support political parties, the Committee called the level of involvement ""unprecedented"" and a ""gross abuse of public trust"". A total of 99 Republican candidates were supported by the actions.
 Political Affairs requested that its officials attend events of and support key members of the 2006–2007 Congressional race. Administration officials attended a total of 425 events, including parties, fundraising dinners, speeches, and appearances with Republican candidates — an average of more than an event each day of the election season. A third of the events were paid for with tax dollars. 
 White House emails used in the report referred to the taxpayer-funded events as ""top priorities"". 
 Former Political Affairs director Ken Melhman said during an investigative interview that it was a ""big part"" of his job was to ""help elect allies of the President"". The job was legal, he said, because it promoted executive allies. Mehlman had discussed his actions with the White House Counsel of the time, Alberto Gonzales, who approved of the efforts.
 The Committee noted that the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, John Walters, helped with nineteen events though his position was restricted from campaign activities.
 Mehlman said that his department had worked directly with the National Republican Congressional Committee on the strategy. They had worked together to pick ""vulnerable Republican incumbents"", ""battleground races"" and ""places where they agreed the most help was needed"". The White House kept a 'target list' of 'allies' who were in tight races. 
 Investigators also questioned Sara Taylor, a former director of Political Affairs and Karl Rove aid. According to the report, Taylor resisted questioning and ""misled the Committee about her actions"". Taylor said the trips were efforts to be helpful but could not remember why some were helped and others not.
 The report recommended an amendment of the Hatch Act and for the Political Affairs department to be abolished.
 Republican Representative Tom Davis, a senior member of the Committee, said that every administration since Eisenhower has done similar things. He said the Democrats had set out to find banned activity and had ""feigned shock"", calling their response ""righteous indignation"".
 A White House spokesman accused the Committee of trying to ""score political points"", and that the report was a waste of time and taxpayer money.

"," Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, has moved to first place among the field of Republican Party presidential candidates in the latest survey from Public Policy Polling (PPP).  The poll, released on Monday, shows Gingrich with 28 percent support; three points ahead of businessman Herman Cain, and ten points ahead of former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. The result reflects a thirteen point increase for Gingrich since last month's PPP survey.   
 Gingrich, 68, represented the sixth congressional district of Georgia for twenty years (1979–1999), four of which were spent as Speaker (1995–1999). In 1995 he was named Time Magazine's Man of the Year for his leadership in the Republican Party's takeover of Congress. Since leaving Congress, he has worked in the private sector and academia.
 Gingrich's 2012 presidential campaign had a rocky start earlier this year.  In May, during an interview on Meet the Press, he criticized a conservative-backed budget plan as ""right-wing social engineering"", and later in the month, was reported to have sustained a hefty debt at Tiffany & Co. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor observed that ""Many have said now he's finished."" This summer, his campaign took its greatest hit when most of his campaign staff resigned. In July, Gingrich's support fell to one percent in a Zogby International poll. 
 At this point, Gingrich tried to focus on the presidential debates.  According to CNN, voters responded well to both his attacks on the media and his political ideas, including his new ""Contract with America"", stylized after the document he helped draft ahead of the 1995 Republican takeover. In late September, Gingrich returned to double digits in a Fox News poll. In October, he raised $3 million.
 According to the The Daily Caller,  Gingrich's latest surge likely came about from last week's debate performances. However, it also coincides with the decreasing support for Herman Cain amid sexual harassment allegations. PPP determined that 73 percent of Cain supporters hold a favorable opinion of Gingrich, compared to 68 percent of all Republicans.
 Analysts now consider Gingrich as the anti-Romney candidate, an alternative for conservatives who believe Mitt Romney is too liberal.  This position had previously been filled by Representative Michele Bachmann, Texas governor Rick Perry, and most recently Herman Cain. 
 Gingrich hopes his message will resonate better with voters than the previous frontrunners, and that this will lead to his election.

"," President Bush today confirmed that the CIA has held up to 100 terrorism suspects in secret overseas prisons. Speaking in a televised announcement, he said the CIA no longer held any prisoners and was disclosing information on the men's detention because the interrogation was complete. 14 of the men have been moved from  CIA custody to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
 Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, is thought to be among 14 suspects moved, including Ramzi Binalshibh and Abu Zubaydah.
 President Bush said that the CIA interrogations had been vital in tracking down and capturing further suspects; such as Mohammed. He denied that the men were tortured: ""The US does not torture. I have not authorised it and I will not."" Despite the frank disclosure the President would not confirm exactly where the secret prisons had been located, although last year The Washington Post reported on the possible existence of detention centers in Eastern Europe causing deep concern in the EU. The European Parliament also protested against so called 'rendition' flights across Europe to transport prisoners to the secret centers.
 The announcement comes a month after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the use of military commissions to try detainees was illegal. The president's proposal will help lay the groundwork for congressional legislation proposals, that if approved, would establish a legal basis for allowing military tribunal hearings of some prisoners held in the Cuban base. Mr Bush, speaking alongside family members of 9/11 victims, said it was now up to Congress to authorize the commissions so that, ""the men our intelligence officials believe orchestrated the deaths of nearly 3,000 Americans on September 11, 2001, can face justice."" The new policy is more like a military tribunal than the previous proposals.
 The president said he would submit the legislation today for consideration. It is reportedly causing controversy on Capitol Hill leaving Bush facing a potential rebellion from his own party, something he will be keen to avoid with his mid-term elections approaching. A spokesman for the Senate subcommittee that will consider the bill said there were ""some sticking points with the administration"" over the exact content.
 A major part of the bill marks a role reversal by the Pentagon; previously the administration had argued that many of the detainees were ""illegal combatants"" and so not subject to the Geneva convention. The military commissions will now cover all Guantanamo Bay suspects with the convention, which, among other things, expressly forbids the use of torture. The president said that the bill would also ensure that individual US soldiers could not be sued by detainees in US courts.
 The announcements coincide with a renewed focus on terrorism by Bush's Republican administration and comes as the party faces a tough mid-term election later this year.
 The president concluded that the interrogation program had helped to prevent terrorism in America: ""Were it not for this program, our intelligence community believes that al Qaeda and its allies would have succeeded in launching another attack against the American homeland. By giving us information about terrorist plans we could not get anywhere else, this program has saved innocent lives.""

"," United States President George W. Bush is to meet with Democratic congressional leaders today. The two sides will try to find a compromise on a US$124 billion supplemental appropriations bill that would provide funding for US operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Yesterday, Bush vetoed the spending bill which called for a withdrawal from Iraq to begin this year. In his written veto statement, he said he did it because otherwise politicians could ""micromanage the commanders in the field.""
 Bush said he considered the legislation unconstitutional because ""it purports to direct the conduct of the operations of the war in a way that infringes upon the powers vested in the presidency by the Constitution, including as commander in chief of the armed forces.""
 ""If the president thinks by vetoing this bill he'll stop us from working to change the direction of the war in Iraq, he is mistaken,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
 ""There are a number of Republicans who do think that some kind of benchmarks, properly crafted, would actually be helpful,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
 Meanwhile, the House of Representatives failed to override the veto. The vote came in at 222 to 203 (52.2% in favour of the override), well short of the two-thirds majority needed to overturn a presidential veto.

"," US President George W. Bush is pushing for a national ban on gay marriage, as the US Senate opened a debate on a constitutional amendment to prohibit same-sex marriage. ""Changing the definition of marriage would undermine the structure of the family,"" said Bush, who raised the issue at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
 ""The Defense of Marriage Act declares that no state is required to accept another state's definition of marriage. If that act is overturned by the courts, then marriage recognized in one city or state may have to be recognized as marriages everywhere else,"" said the President.
 Bush criticized judges who overturned state laws. State legislatures ""are being thwarted by activist judges who are overturning the expressed will of their people... Marriage is the most fundamental institution of civilization, and it should not be redefined by activist judges,"" he said.  The ""cornerstone of a healthy society"" is traditional marriage, Bush declared, and the issue should be returned — ""back where it belongs: in the hands of the American people.""
 At the White House, Bush told supporters of the amendment that he's ""proud to stand"" with them. His comments come as the U.S. Senate starts three days of debate on the measure. All Senate Democrats, except Ben Nelson of Nebraska, oppose the ban.
 Whilst many in the Senate do support Bush's amendments, in the final throes of an election cycle, few are prepared to support the bill. ""A vote for this amendment is a vote for bigotry pure and simple,"" said Democratic Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, where the state Supreme Court legalized gay marriages in 2003.
 ""Marriage between one man and one woman does a better job protecting children better than any other institution humankind has devised,"" said Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist. ""As such, marriage as an institution should be protected, not redefined.""
 Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who says he believes marriage is the union of a man and a woman, said he nonetheless would vote against the amendment on a test vote Wednesday.
 ""The reason for this debate is to divide our society, to pit one against another,"" Reid said in remarks prepared for delivery on the Senate floor. ""This is another one of the president's efforts to frighten, to distort, to distract, and to confuse America. It is this administration's way of avoiding the tough, real problems that American citizens are confronted with each and every day.""

"," U.S. President George W. Bush and Congressional leaders from both political parties have reached agreement on US$150 billion in tax relief in an effort to help stimulate the United States economy. VOA White House Correspondent Scott Stearns has the story.
 The agreement includes provision to give up to US$600 in tax rebates to millions of wage earners and an additional US$300 refund for each child. It allows businesses to immediately write off 50 percent of capital equipment purchases.
 President Bush says it is an effective, robust and temporary set of incentives that will boost the economy and create new jobs.
 ""This package has the right set of policies and is the right size,"" he said. ""The incentives in this package will lead to higher consumer spending and increased business investment this year.""
 The president says he knows Americans are concerned about their economic future, with the challenges of higher energy prices and a falling housing market slowing growth.
 President Bush is urging the House of Representatives and Senate to pass the agreement as soon as possible.
 ""We have an opportunity to come together and take the swift, decisive action our economy urgently needs,"" he added.
 Stock markets around the world dipped sharply early this week amid widespread fears of a U.S. recession and its potential to drag down foreign markets as well.
 The stimulus deal was an unusual display of bipartisanship in Washington, with Democrats and Republicans in the House making concessions to get the deal done quickly.
 Republicans dropped a provision that would have allowed businesses to reclaim taxes previously paid. Democrats dropped their demands for increases in food stamps and unemployment benefits.
 House Speaker Democrat Nancy Pelosi says she is not totally pleased with the package, but knows it will help stimulate the economy.
 ""This bipartisan package should be acted upon rapidly and can help alleviate the economic pain felt by millions of Americans,"" she said.
 John Boehner is the leader of Republicans in the House of Representatives. He says it was not easy for Republicans and Democrats to agree on a plan, but he is confident it is in the best interests of the nation.
 ""This agreement is a big win for the American people,"" he said.  ""It will stimulate our economy in the most direct and effective way possible by putting money in the hands of middle income American families and by giving businesses incentives to create and build new jobs in our country.""
 Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was the president's lead negotiator with Congress.
 ""I know the work isn't done yet,"" he noted.  ""As the Speaker said, we've got more to do. And I am looking forward to working with the Senate and working with the House to get a package as soon as possible, because, again, speed is of the essence.""
 Senate Majority Leader Democrat Harry Reid says he wants to get the plan to the president for signature by February 15. But changes in the Senate may slow passage of the package, as Reid says senators may consider restoring provisions to extend unemployment benefits.

"," On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed James Comey from his position as head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Officially, Comey was fired for mishandling the issue with former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's alleged misuse of private email servers, but Senate Democrats and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have raised concerns over whether the real reason may have been that Comey was leading the investigation into the Trump campaign's alleged ties to Russia and possible tampering with the election that placed Trump in high office.
 CNN reports a source within the White House told CNN reporter Dana Bash the President's office gave this reason intending to avoid controversy because many Democrats have also criticized Comey for mishandling the Clinton case, and some have blamed him for Clinton losing the election. Specifically, recently confirmed Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein released a memo criticizing Comey's statements in a July 2016 press conference, in which he called Hillary Clinton ""extremely careless"" for using private email servers to transmit government information but said she would not be charged with a crime. ""The director was wrong to usurp the attorney general's authority on 5 July 2016, and announce his conclusion that the [Clinton] case should be closed without prosecution. [...] Compounding the error, the director ignored another longstanding principle: we do not hold press conferences to release derogatory information about the subject of a declined criminal investigation,"" wrote Rosenstein. 
 ""It simply defies logic that President Trump, who made the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's emails a centerpiece of his campaign, would all of the sudden convert to the view that Clinton was treated unfairly,"" said Democratic Senator Christopher S. Murphy. CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin rejected it as ""absurd."" He went on to compare it to the dismissal of Archibald Cox during the Watergate scandal.
 Anthony Romero of the ACLU also expressed concern: ""The independence of the FBI director is meant to ensure that the president does not operate above the law. For President Trump to fire the man responsible for investigating his own campaign's ties to the Russians imperils that fundamental principle.""
 Most Republicans agreed with Trump's decision. Senator Chuck Grassley said, ""The handling of the Clinton email investigation is a clear example of how Comey's decisions have called into question the trust and political independence of the FBI."" However, Republican Representative Justin Amash referred to the rationale behind the dismissal as ""bizarre"" and said that he and his staff would look into laws that might allow the establishment of an independent commission to continue the Russia investigation. Such a commission has also been called for by Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Bob Casey.
 Minority leader Chuck Schumer said, ""If deputy attorney general Rosenstein does not appoint an independent special prosecutor, every American will rightly suspect that the decision to fire director Comey was part of a cover-up.""
 Schumer was one of several Senate Democrats to ask for a special prosecutor or special counsel. Others, expressing themselves both by Tweet and traditional television interviews, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, and Cory Booker of New Jersey.  However, special prosecutors are appointed by the U.S. Attorney General, in this case Jeff Sessions who recused himself from any further involvement in the investigation into the Trump campaign's ties to Russia.  According to ABC News chief legal analyst Dan Abrams, the responsibility would then fall to a deputy, who would be unlikey to act except in response to pressure from Congress.
 President Trump responded, as is his custom, via tweet: ""Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently, 'I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer.' Then acts so indignant. #draintheswamp"" and ""The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad!"" 
 Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is to serve as acting head of the FBI until a replacement is confirmed.

"," Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), co-chairwoman of the Out of Iraq Caucus and a member of the International Affairs Committee, along with 26 co-sponsors, proposed yesterday a Resolution of Inquiry in the House of Representatives which, if passed, will require the White House and the State Department to
""transmit all information relating to communication with officials of the United Kingdom between January 1, 2002, and October 16, 2002, relating to the policy of the United States with respect to Iraq.""  The resolution, was submitted in the House of Representatives and referred to the U.S. House Committee on International Relations.  
 The resolution comes in response to questions that have been raised about the handling of pre-war intelligence by the Bush administration, and the planning and execution of the Iraq war.  “We would like to see a member of Congress look into whether or not the president committed impeachable offenses,” said John Bonifaz, a constitutional lawyer. “We’ve been having that discussion with a number of offices.”
 Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary Minority leader, recently met with John Bonifaz and representatives.  But Conyers is reluctant to take such a bold step just yet. “My inclination at this time is not to do something like that,” Conyers said, although he noted that he wanted to press for an investigation in other ways, including sending committee investigators to London.
 Earlier this month, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) said at a forum held by Conyers “If you read the record of the writing of the Constitution, ‘high crimes and misdemeanors’ had a very particular meaning at the time of the drafting of the Constitution. It certainly didn’t mean lying about sex, but it might well mean lying to the Congress about a large public purpose such as Iraq.”, referring to Republican's filing of such a resolution in 1998 in an effort to remove Bill Clinton from office.
 Rep. Barbara Lee's resolution of inquiry is a less-drastic parliamentary maneuver that would ask the administration to provide more information related to the claims in classified British memos that suggest that pre-war intelligence in Iraq was ""fixed"" in order to justify the invasion.  The Resolution of Inquiry is a privileged resolution, which means that if it is not acted on in 14 legislative days after it is introduced, the member of Congress who introduced it is entitled to request that it be brought to the House floor for a vote.  The committee may take the matter up right away, and could vote it down before the August recess. If they do not, they will be required to take it up by September 16th.

The report made its way to U.S. Congress via Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Although the scope of study is large, investigating the status of illicit narcotics in almost every country during 2004, attention has focused on Afghanistan. With more than 510,000 sprawling acres of the impoverished country (three times the amount in 2003) utilized for Opium poppy cultivation (the raw material for heroin), the report warns that the country is becoming a ""narcotics state"" like Colombia for cocaine.
 In addition, the report indicated that Afghanistan's opium production soared to 5,445 tons last year, producing 17 times more of the raw drug material than second-place Myanmar. The report stated that the explosion of narcotic production in Afghanistan is ""an enormous threat to world stability.""
 To combat this issue, the Bush administration has proposed US$780 million to institute a plan that works on two levels: to promote alternative crops to farmers and to increase military interdiction for finding and destroying heroin labs and storage facilities. At the time of publishing, the U.S. government has already committed US$1.2 billion to counter-narcotics activities for 2005.

Fellow Republicans, spear-headed by Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Melissa Hart (R-PA), began circulating a petition last week urging to elect a new majority speaker, thus setting the stage for House leadership elections.
 In a letter written and addressed to fellow House Republicans on Saturday, DeLay said, ""During my time in Congress, I have always acted in an ethical manner within the rules of our body and the laws of our land.""
 He asked Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert to convene a body to elect a new majority leader. ""I cannot allow our adversaries to divide and distract our attention,"" wrote DeLay.
 The 58-year-old DeLay held the leadership post for 3 years, until he was forced to relinquish it in late 2005 after he became involved in an ethics scandal. He stepped down after a Texas jury indicted him for money laundering and conspiracy, but initially planned to re-seek the majority speaker post if he was acquitted.

"," The U.S. House Committee on International Relations voted Wednesday on a Resolution of Inquiry that would have required the White House and State Department to ""transmit all information relating to communication with officials of the United Kingdom between January 1, 2002, and October 16, 2002, relating to the policy of the United States with respect to Iraq.""  The resolution comes in response to questions that have been raised by senior intelligence officials and information revealed in leaked U.K. documents such as the Downing Street Memo, regarding the handling of pre-war intelligence by the Bush administration, and the planning and execution of the Iraq war.
 Originally proposed by Congresswoman Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), the Resolution of Inquiry had 83 co-sponsors at the time of voting, including one Republican member of the International Relations Committee, Jim Leach, who was the only Republican voting in favor of the resolution.  
 Some members of the committee from each party were absent.

"," Republican Congressman Ron Paul of Texas announced Tuesday that he will end his twelve-term career in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013 when his current term expires.  He will not seek re-election in 2012, but rather will focus fully on his campaign to win the presidential nomination of the Republican Party. He previously mounted two unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 1988 and 2008.  
 Paul, 75, has held his House seat for Texas's 14th congressional district since 1997, and previously held another House seat for Texas from 1976 to 1977 and 1979 to 1985.  He ran for president as the Libertarian Party's nominee in 1988, but finished in third place with approximately 0.47 percent of the vote.  Paul later returned to the Republican Party and Congress in the 1990s, and sought the party's 2008 presidential nomination while simultaneously running for re-election in the House. Despite an enthusiastic internet following that broke fundraising records, he lost the nomination to Senator John McCain of Arizona.  
 Nevertheless, Paul feels better about his chances to win the 2012 nomination, stating ""We have a lot more support right now, things are doing well for us.""  According to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal Republican presidential poll, Paul is tied with Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota for second place with 11 percent, behind former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who stands at 43 percent. 
 Paul, who won re-election in 2010 with 76 percent of the vote, commented that his early announcement would give political aspirants plenty of time to decide to run for his seat, which represents ten counties along the Texas Gulf Coast.

"," Sam Brownback is perplexed.  The U.S. Senator from Kansas and Presidential candidate is a Republican whose politics—he is against marriage for gay people, he is against abortion, and he has a clean image in a party tainted by scandal—should speak favorably to the party's base.  But it has not.  ""I'm baffled by that myself,"" Senator Brownback told Wikinews reporter David Shankbone.  ""We haven't been able to raise money.""  
 A recent poll in Iowa has put him in eighth place, with 2% supporting his campaign.  ""If we don't finish fourth or better in Iowa...we'll pull out.""  
 Senator Brownback's relationship with God infuses almost every answer you find below.  Although he doesn't feel ""competent"" to explain why God would dislike gays, he does feel strongly that allowing two men or two women to enter into the union of marriage will destroy it for heterosexuals.  Pointing to the research of Stanley Kurtz at the Hoover Institution, Brownback asserts that Northern Europeans have ""taken the sacredness out of the institution."" 
 In the interview, Senator Brownback discusses the tug-and-pull that befalls him when his constituents show up at his office and say, ""Look, I'm a conservative, but we need this bridge, we need this subsidy, we need this hospital.”  Brownback feels this spending system needs to be changed; however, when it comes to energy policy, Brownback is there for his constituents.  David Shankbone asked the Kansas Senator, a supporter of cellulosic ethanol, why he doesn't support the lowering of tariffs on sugar since sugar ethanol delivers 8 times the energy output of cellulosic ethanol.  Brazil, in particular, has become energy independent because of its sugar ethanol program.  It's cheaper to produce, and there is vastly more bang for the buck in sugar fuel than in corn fuel; an entire country no longer needs to import oil because of it.  Federal tariffs currently make sugar ethanol too expensive in the United States.  ""You're going to kill the ethanol industry here just as it gets going,"" was Senator Brownback's response.  However, there is a debate over whether the process to make corn ethanol uses more energy than the ethanol itself produces.  
 Below is David Shankbone's interview with Senator Sam Brownback.
 David Shankbone:  Senator Brownback, how are you?
 DS: I read that.
 DS: Is it pretty gratifying for you to work with people on the other side of the aisle to try and find solutions?
 DS:  I remember sort of the old days where you'd hear about Ted Kennedy being best friends with Orrin Hatch; do you think that the Tom DeLay period ushered in an era where people were too opposed to each other on the sides of the aisle?
 DS: Running for President has to be a grueling experience, and there must be a million things that you see out there when you're on the road that either you had not thought about before or you didn't know existed.  Could you tell me about one?
 DS:  That's great.  Throughout my life, my father, who is an avid lifelong Republican, he used to tell me--this is a question that I'd asked Tom Tancredo as well, but I think it really comes down to one of the central issues in this race--he had said, ""All we need is a Republican Congress, a Republican Senate, and a Republican White House to get the country on the right track.""  And last year, he expressed to me that he was very disappointed with where things have gone with the Republicans running things.  He feels let down; he feels like he was lied to by the Party, either through the rationale for the Iraq war, the sex and bribery scandals, the pork barrel projects, and, as Alan Greenspan said, the fiscal irresponsibility.  He feels like there have been many broken promises.  Why should someone like my father vote Republican today?  And I can assure you he will.  But why do you think he should?
 DS:  When you think about dropping out of the race, what emotions do you feel?
 DS:  You've discussed it, and I'm just wondering when it's a thought that occurs to you-- not an inevitability---just when you think about it as a possibility, how do you feel when you reflect upon it?
 DS:  Do you feel sad when you think about possibly leaving?
 DS:  Evangelical candidates haven't fared particularly well in this primary season.  What do you think is the reason for that?
 DS:  The Democrats often have concerns about the electability of their candidates; Hillary Clinton, for example. Do you think that it might scare some people that in this point in time that Evangelicals aren't particularly electable?
 DS:  Do you think Mitt Romney's Mormonism is an issue that people should take into consideration?
 DS:  What if someone was a Zoroastrian?
 DS:  Or a Satanist.
 DS:  Really?
 DS:  Even though religious beliefs are so fundamental to a person?  It's more of a policy issue than it is a faith issue?
 DS:  If someone told you that they were scared to vote for someone who doesn't believe in evolution, what would you say to that person?
 DS:  You don’t think that evolution is incompatible with an intelligent design theory?  That we could have evolved based upon the evolution idea, but that it could have still been the work of God?
 DS:  What's your personal belief on that?
 DS:  It works.
 DS:  What do you think is the greatest threat to humanity?
 DS:  What is the culture of life?  How would you describe that phrase?
 DS:  Bobby Schindler, Terry Schiavo's brother, endorsed your candidacy by saying that ""Sam Brownback is the pro-life conservative we can trust to stand for all life, regardless of political calculations.""  Do you think the death penalty detracts from the culture of life?
 DS:  A common question I've asked in my interviews is about the Iraq War and how it has affected someone as a person.  People often proffer their opinion on the war, but they don't really talk much about how it has affected them personally, perhaps in their world view.  The writer Gay Talese insisted the war has not affected him at all. ""I wish it had,"" he said.  Talese thinks there's a problem with Americans not sacrificing enough, and he argued that we need conscription.  Do you think we need conscription, if not to support the manpower of the war, to make Americans more involved with the wars that we are fighting?
 DS:  What you think the proper role of Congress is in a time of war?
 DS:  Do you feel the American people were misled with the war in Iraq?
 DS:  What do you think is going to happen to Egypt after Mubarak?
 DS:  Do you think it's a bad idea to have elections in countries if it's possible that an Islamic extremist group will win, such as happened in Palestine with Hamas?
 DS:  Do you think that things like the Bridge to Nowhere are projects that shouldn't be funded?  And I'm using that popular phrase--I realize it's a little emotionally charged--but things such as that.
 DS:  You support the Elon plan that would essentially allow Israel to keep the entire West Bank while taking little responsibility for its Arab residents.  The plan is against U.S., Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian policies.  Why do you think that would advance peace in the Middle East?
 DS:  I interviewed the writer Augusten Burroughs.  I would like you to answer a question that he posed.  He said that ""God does not care that the person I watch TV with also has hairy arms, that the idea that a God would not like homosexuals is patently absurd, that it doesn't even begin to become logical in any way, that the idea that the architect of gravity, the being that created the ability for elemental particles that are absolutely nothing to come together and create living organisms and bricks and buildings and cars and jets, that the architect of absolutely everything would care about the sex of the person that this little human loves seems ridiculous.""  Why is that not ridiculous?
 DS:  Why do you think it would bother God that somebody is gay?
 DS:  In what country that has passed same-sex marriage has traditional marriage declined?
 DS:  Got you.
 DS:  Why did you vote against the Federal expansion of hate crimes to include sexual orientation?
 DS:  Ministers speaking out against homosexuality would come under the province of a hate crime?
 DS:  If you could choose your manner of death, how would you die?
 DS:  It's a Marcel Proust question.
 DS:  But you've never thought about how--if you could choose how you'd prefer to die?
 DS:  It seems like such a basic human thing to contemplate, one's mortality.  I mean, I believe you, but--
 DS:  What weren't you happy with?
 DS:  That was your--
 DS:  Was that your impetus to run for the Senate?
 DS:  What trait do you deplore in other people?
 DS:  Oh...
 DS:  Do you believe that a good Christian should also be a good environmentalist?
 DS:  How so?
 DS:  And you don’t think that Arctic drilling contradicts that notion?
 DS:  What about sugar ethanol?
 DS:  Do you think we should lower tariffs on sugar in order to be able to import more Brazilian sugar ethanol?
 DS:  But it would reduce our dependency on foreign oil, thus increasing our national security, wouldn't it?  Or is the ethanol industry here more important?
 DS:  But the energy that you derive from that is so much less than it is in sugar ethanol.
 DS:  Senator, do you think that Wikipedia is important?
 DS:  Definitely.  What do you find important about it?
 DS:  I tried to get an interview with David Miscavige of the Church of Scientology, and I spoke to their Director of Public Relations; I had about a twenty-minute phone call with him, and he was very hostile to it.  One of the things that I'd said to him--because he was saying that a lot of information is incorrect--I made the point to him that, ""You know, it may be incorrect, but the idea is that you can have Scientologists go on there to correct it.""  It's not a one-sided place for information; if you feel that there's inaccuracies, the idea is that you can also have people who know the truth go on there and correct it and debate about it, if that is what is necessary to get an accurate view.  Whereas if you say something to Newsweek, and they print something that's incorrect, you're stuck.
 DS:  Very good to talk to you.  Best of luck, Senator Brownback.

"," Women's rights advocate and Georgetown University Law Center graduate Sandra Fluke announced her candidacy yesterday to run for the California State Senate.
 The Democrat previously stated she would run for a seat in the United States Congress being vacated by retiring Congressman Henry Waxman. She informed the Los Angeles Times that she decided to run for the California State Senate instead of the U.S. Congress because she felt she would be able to accomplish more for the people of California as a state Senator.
 She will attempt to gain election to the seat currently occupied by Ted Lieu, a Democrat from Torrance, California. Lieu is currently in the beginning of his own campaign for Congressman Waxman's seat representing California's 33rd congressional district.
 In a release to the press, Fluke said: ""I am extremely moved by the outpouring of local and national support I have received since I announced that I was considering running for office. My entire career has been devoted to the public interest, whether representing victims of human trafficking or advocating for working families.""
 She described her intentions for the California legislature: ""I am committed to continuing that fight in Sacramento, working to protect our environment, ensure our access to health care, and create the jobs that are desperately needed. While I strongly considered offering my candidacy for Congress, I feel there is a better way for me to advance the causes that are important to our community.""
 Fluke characterized herself as a new voice for progressivism: ""I believe that the families and communities of this district — from West Hollywood to West L.A. and from Santa Monica to Torrance and beyond — deserve to have a fresh perspective from a new generation of progressive leadership in Sacramento, and I am eager to get to work fighting for the causes that matter most to our future as a community, state and nation.""
 After graduating from law school, Fluke moved to Los Angeles where she used her skills as a lawyer to help improve conditions for individuals related to improving the living wage and advocating for better foster care for children.
 Fluke was nominated as a candidate by Time magazine for their Person of the Year of 2012. Time concluded Fluke helped give U.S. President Barack Obama an edge in his 2012 presidential re-election campaign.
 Fluke was a featured speaker on September 5, 2012 at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. Fluke spoke to attendees at the convention about the consequences for women of electing Republican candidate for U.S. President Mitt Romney over incumbent President Barack Obama. Fluke campaigned with President Obama in his bid for re-election.
 She was recognized April 22, 2012 with the Stand Up for Choice Award. Fluke was given the Stand Up for Choice Award at the ""Third Annual Multi-Generational Brunch"" of the organization NARAL Pro-Choice America which was held in New York City (NYC), New York in the United States. 
 Fluke received a nomination in March 2012 as a candidate for Time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. The list is released annually as a special edition of Time magazine, titled Time 100.
 She gave testimony to the US Congress on February 23, 2012 before the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee at a hearing about women's health and contraception. She also worked for Sanctuary for Families in NYC which worked to crack down on human trafficking and domestic violence.

 She encouraged listeners to her speech to use their vote for the next U.S. President as a voice, stating, ""I'm here because I spoke out, and this November, each of us must speak out.""
 Fluke contrasted possible scenarios which could result from a Republican-controlled White House with that of President Obama's administration's support of women's issues, and commented, ""During this campaign, we've heard about the two profoundly different futures that could await women -- and how one of those futures looks like an offensive, obsolete relic of our past.""
 She concluded her remarks by asserting that Mitt Romney would not place emphasis on women's rights, observing, ""And six months from now, we'll all be living in one, or the other. But only one. A country where our president either has our back or turns his back."" 
 Fluke's speech was well received throughout by the audience, and garnered her a standing ovation from the crowd. After her speech, Fluke took to Twitter to thank convention participants for the positive reaction she received, tweeting, ""#DNC2012, THANK YOU for such a warm welcome! But thank you more for standing for #women!""

She currently resides in Los Angeles, California with her fiancé and ""Mr. President"", their pet dog.

 Fluke's speech centered on women's rights, women's healthcare, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. She stressed the importance of women's issues in the recent election for U.S. President: ""This year, something changed in our national conversation about women’s health.... Before my time, women's healthcare has never decided a presidential election. We really did make a difference this election."" She spurred on attendees of the event to become more active in supporting women's rights: ""It’s time for young women in this country to join the fight, because it’s our rights and our health that are at stake.""
 Planned Parenthood regional development and planned gifts director Tari Hendrickson told the Lincoln Journal Star Sandra Fluke was her top choice for keynote speaker at the event: ""Sandra was No. 1 on my list; I never had a No. 2. She's a voice of reason. I think she has raised the bar for rational conversation about a serious issue.""
 Planned Parenthood of the Heartland Planned Nebraska communications manager Susan Allen told the Daily Nebraskan Sandra Fluke was the ideal person to serve as keynote speaker: ""She is a wonderfully outspoken person on the affordable care act, women's health and women's rights. We decided she would be the perfect person to speak to Planned Parenthood supporters.""

"," In an opinion piece published by CNN on Tuesday, Georgetown University law student and women's rights advocate Sandra Fluke insisted she will not allow slurs from critics to silence her and other women from continuing to speak out on issues regarding women's health and contraception.
 Fluke has faced slurs and personal attacks after speaking before the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee in the United States House of Representatives about women’s health and contraception. She was called a ""slut"" and a ""prostitute"" by talk radio show host Rush Limbaugh. In response to these attacks, Fluke has received public support from women, members of the media, and politicians including the President of the United States.
 In her piece for CNN, Fluke took the opportunity to thank her supporters, writing, “By now, many have heard the stories I wanted to share thanks to the congressional leaders and members of the media who have supported me and millions of women in speaking out.” She characterized the “opponents of reproductive health access” who issued personal attacks against her as being motivated by an attempt to change the topic of conversation away from a dialogue about women’s health, and “to silence women's voices regarding their own health care.”
 Fluke wrote that the efforts by some to drown out women from speaking out about women’s health were unsuccessful. She came to this conclusion due to the multitude of positive comments and encouragement sent to her by both female and male individuals urging that contraception medication be considered a medical necessity.
 Asserting that she would not remain silent on this issue of women’s health, Fluke wrote, “Attacking me and women who use contraception by calling us prostitutes and worse cannot silence us.”
 She noted that a significant majority of women have utilized contraception medication, and commented that there exists a social disconnect between politicians attempting to make it more difficult for women to access this type of health care, and the views of society-at-large about the matter: “Restricting access to such a basic health care service, which 99% of sexually experienced American women have used and 62% of American women are using right now, is out of touch with public sentiment.”
 Fluke concluded her piece by emphasizing that those in power should not govern based on ideology: “I am proud to stand with the millions of women and men who recognize that our government should legislate according to the reality of our lives -- not for ideology.”
 After being banned by Congressman Darrell Issa from speaking before a Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on February 16 which consisted mainly of male panelists, Fluke appeared before a meeting of the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee convened by Minority leader of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi on February 23.
 Fluke spoke to the committee about the need for contraception to be covered by health care plans offered by employers, as a matter integral to women’s health. She cited multiple cases where women take contraception medication as part of their health care for treatment of medical conditions unrelated to birth control, including two women who suffer from polycystic ovarian syndrome, a woman who is afflicted with endometriosis and another who takes contraception in order to prevent seizures.
 Speaking before the United States Senate on February 17 along with fellow members Patty Murray, Kirsten Gillibrand, Barbara Boxer, and Charles Schumer, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire expressed her support for Fluke. Like Fluke, Senator Shaheen pointed out the need not to silence the voices of women in the public government debate about women’s health care: “Time and time again, women have been silenced in this discussion, a discussion about our own very personal health care decisions.” Senator Shaheen concluded her remarks with an explanation as to why she believes women should have significant representation in discussions about their health care: “Women deserve a voice in this debate because, after all, in the end this is about our health and it is about a health care decision that is between women, their families, their doctors, and their own faith.”
 President Barack Obama called Fluke on March 2 to express his support for her courage to speak out on issues of women’s health. In his first press conference of 2012 on March 6, he discussed his reasons for deciding to call Fluke. 
 The President cited his personal thoughts about his own two daughters: “And the reason I called Ms. Fluke is because I thought about Malia and Sasha [Obama's daughters], and one of the things I want them to do as they get older is to engage in issues they care about, even ones I may not agree with them on. I want them to be able to speak their mind in a civil and thoughtful way. And I don't want them attacked or called horrible names because they're being good citizens.”
 President Obama went on to state that Fluke served as a positive role model for citizen participation in democracy and society: “And I wanted Sandra to know that I thought her parents should be proud of her, and that we want to send a message to all our young people that being part of a democracy involves argument and disagreements and debate, and we want you to be engaged, and there's a way to do it that doesn't involve you being demeaned and insulted, particularly when you’re a private citizen.”

"," Women's rights advocate and Georgetown University Law Center graduate Sandra Fluke has been named as a candidate by Time magazine for their Person of the Year.
 Sandra Fluke was the focus of media in February after attempting to testify before a Republican-controlled committee in the United States House of Representatives about contraception and women's health. Kate Pickert of Time wrote in her profile, ""Fluke ... weathered the attention with poise and maturity and emerged as a political celebrity."" 
 Time concluded Fluke helped give U.S. President Barack Obama an edge in his presidential re-election campaign: ""Democrats gave her a national-convention speaking slot as part of their push to make reproductive rights a central issue in the 2012 presidential campaign — one that helped Barack Obama trounce Mitt Romney among single women on Election Day.""
 Fluke responded to the nomination via Twitter, and stated she was ""Honored to be listed for Time's Person of Year"". In the same statement she also drew attention to the scarcity of women on the list of candidates.
 An analysis of Fluke's candidacy by Peter Roff of U.S. News & World Report called attention to her role in the political phenomenon in the recent election cycle known as the ""War on Women"" which drew significant attention to issues of women's rights. Roff gave advice to the Republican party on the way it relates to women, ""Once the Republicans become comfortable talking about all issues as though they were women's issues too — issues like unemployment, economic growth, job creation, education, and healthcare as well as the so-called social issues — they will be demonstrating that women have a home in the GOP. Until they do however it will be the Sandra Flukes of the world that continue to carry the day when it counts.""
 Journalist Leslie Marshall observed some conservative political commentators were critical of Time for its nomination of Fluke for Person of the Year. 
 Marshall argued Fluke belongs on the list: ""She should be credited with reminding women on both the right and the left; that many of us agree on the issue of women's reproductive rights. Although some of us might be Democrats and some Republicans, our gender unites us. She brought more women to the polls, reminding us of the decades it took to be where we are and what was at stake for women if we did not re-elect President Obama. In speaking at the Democratic National Convention, she showed true strength over adversity. And she has since become a women's health activist. For these reasons alone, she belongs on this list.""
 However, Marshall stated she wouldn't be voting for Fluke's candidacy, but would instead cast her ballot for Malala Yousafzai, a 15-year-old female education activist who survived a Taliban assassination attempt.
 Fluke was a featured speaker on September 5 at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.

 The organization's president, Nancy Keenan, attended the event and had previously spoken in favor of Fluke in a press release announcing the award. ""Sandra is a remarkable leader and a true hero in the reproductive-rights community. This event brings together women and men from many generations, and the one thing that unites us all is the personal stories that are the reason for our joining this cause. Without a doubt, many people have witnessed Sandra's strength over these last few weeks and have been inspired to join her in standing up for women's freedom and privacy.""
 Chair of the NARAL Pro-Choice America’s Future Direction Committee Amanda Hirsh released a statement in support of Fluke saying, ""we are thrilled to honor Sandra Fluke with the Stand Up For Choice Award at this year's multi-generational brunch. Attempts to silence voices like Sandra's have failed. Young leaders across the country are looking to Sandra as an inspiration.""

"," Sandra Fluke, Chelsea Clinton, and Speaker of the New York City Council Christine Quinn were among the guests who discussed the role of women in politics at the 92nd Street Y in New York City yesterday evening. The forum was co-hosted by Glamour magazine. 
 Clinton led the panel; Fluke and Quinn were joined by additional panelists including the communications chief to former President George W. Bush, Nicolle Wallace; Abby Huntsman Livingston, daughter of former Republican presidential candidate and past governor of Utah and United States Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman; the President of EMILY's List, Stephanie Schriock; and news anchor Amy Holmes.
 Fluke remarked upon the slew of media reactions to her February 23 U.S. Congressional testimony about women's health and contraception,  ""One of the things I was really concerned about when ... verbal attacks began was what kind of message this was going to send to young women... I was worried they would think, 'I should sit down and shut up, because if I speak out, this is what happens' ... I want women to see this as an empowering moment.""
 Wallace commented that women should be inspired to work in government due to a motivation of public service, ""If you were asked, 'Will you serve?' you'd say, 'Of course!'... Part of the problem is that our politics are so sick — there's very little young women see in our news about the essence of what the office once was, which is, public service."" She noted the potential impact of women voters on the upcoming 2012 U.S. presidential election, ""Women don't vote in a bloc, but they are the largest percentage of independent voters"".
 Clinton pointed out that the United States is joined by the country of Turkmenistan for 78th place in a ranking of the proportion of female members of the federal government. She noted, ""Until my mother ran for president, I wasn’t fully cognizant of how few women run for office and how few women hold office"". 
 Quinn informed the panel that when she initially decided to attempt to become Speaker of the New York City Council, critics told her why she would fail, 
""Because I was from the west side of Manhattan, cause I was too liberal, because I was a woman, because I was a lesbian, all things I knew when I woke up that morning, you know what I’m saying."" She asserted that politics in New York need not be tied to a particular politician's sex, and stated, ""the sky is the limit in New York.""
 Schriock emphasized there are indeed women placed in federal elections in the U.S., ""They're running for office right now in 2012. We have a historic number of women running for the United States Senate"". She posed the question of how to ensure these candidates succeed in their elections.
 Wallace admitted that she authored novels It's Classified and Eighteen Acres as a cathartic form of expressing herself after viewing the pressures Hillary Clinton, Sarah Palin, and Michelle Obama experienced in the media during the 2008 campaign cycle. ""I was so scarred by 2008 I made up an imaginary world"".

"," Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke fielded questions from the Senate Banking Committee today. Paulson and Bernanke were joined by Christopher Cox, chairman of the SEC, and James Lockhart, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The four urged the Committee to pass legislation allowing the Treasury to spend up to US$700 billion to bailout investment banks by purchasing their ""illiquid debt"".
 They made the pitch to the committee to bail out Wall Street by passing legislation giving the Treasury unprecedented authority and little oversight. The $700 billion will bail out investment banks with illiquid mortgage assets, securities these firms cannot sell because of the state of the housing sector. The proposal will create a reverse auction, in which the illiquid debt will be bought by the Treasury at a price much higher than the fire sale prices the securities are currently valued out.
 The debate centered around whether the government should be involved, is $700 billion too much, will it work, the issue of oversight, and the urgency of the situation.
 Paulson and Bernanke claimed that such a bailout is precondition to a healthy recovery to the economy; credit is contingent on a healthy economy, the purchase of the bad debt will increase the lending to business and consumers to help the recovery of the economy.

"," A report released by the US Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday concluded that the CIA misinformed the White House and Congress about its imprisonment and interrogation of suspected terrorists during the years after the September 11 attacks. 
 The committee released an executive summary yesterday ahead of its full 6,000-page report. The summary documented instances where detainees were kept awake for as long as a week and suggested that the agency had waterboarded more suspects than it previously disclosed.
 The report also revealed that officials in the Bush administration were often told about these practices long after the fact. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Secretary of State Colin Powell were not told of the CIA's operations until a year after they had begun. President Bush was briefed in 2006, four years after the CIA commenced its ""Enhanced Interrogation Techniques"" program.
 The released documents refutes the effectiveness of the program and the accuracy of the information gathered. Previously, the Bush administration had defended its use, claiming that the intelligence garnered helped stop terrorist plots and capture al-Qaeda leadership, including Osama bin Laden. The executive summary examines case studies from the CIA's internal records which the committee says disputes those defenses.
 CIA Director John O. Brennan acknowledged many of the failures outlined by the committee, but also rebuked it for what he called an “incomplete and selective picture of what occurred.” Republican Senators have been critical of the report with Richard Burr calling it ""a fiction"", and Marco Rubio stating that Senate Democrats published the report out of ""partisan joy"" with the intention of ""trying to embarrass people in the Bush administration.""

The alleged perpetrator, a 66-year-old Illinois man, was shot by police and later died in a hospital.
 According to Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks, the shooter was in the dugout behind third base.  Team members saw Scalise crawl away from second base after he was shot.  According to Senator Jeff Flake, Scalise's security team fired upon the shooter.  Flake and Congressman Brad Wenstrup, a physician, went to Scalise and attempted to staunch the bleeding until help could arrive. Scalise was still in critical condition yesterday, who was admitted to MedStar Washington Hospital Center, though some of the other injured had been released.
 ""Nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police,"" Kentucky Senator Rand Paul told CNN. ""It would have been a massacre without them."" 
 The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the shooter as James T. Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois.  Hodgkinson, who worked as a home inspector until earlier this year, had made posts on the Internet condemning the Republican tax plan, attended at least one 99% rally in 2012. He had campaigned for Democrat Bernie Sanders in last year's U.S. presidential race, Sanders said; Sanders condemned Hodgkinson's actions, saying he was ""sickened by this despicable act.""
 A 7.62 mm SKS rifle and a nine mm pistol were obtained from the scene. According​ to the FBI, the shooter acquired the arms legally.
 Hodgkinson has written many letters to a local newspaper News-Democrat with comments such as ""This country is in need of a major change in more ways than one, but let's start with the federal income tax rates"" in 2008 and ""We need to vote all Republicans out of office"" in 2011. The day before the shooting, Hodgkinson had had a brief but intense in-person outburst in which he said that President Trump messed up the U.S. ""more than anyone in the history of this country.""
 In 2006, Hodgkinson was arrested after allegedly punching a woman in the face and attempting to choke someone.  He also fired a shotgun as part of that incident. The charges were later dismissed.  In March, police responded to reports of a gunshot at Hodgkinson's home and found him holding a hunting rifle.  After ascertaining that he had a license for said firearm, they left him with a warning.

"," Sirius CEO Mel Karmazin appeared before a newly formed Antitrust Task Force, a sub-committee of the House Judiciary Committee, on Wednesday last week in Washington, D.C. to defend the proposed U.S. merger between XM and Sirius satellite radio services. 
 The hearing, carried live on C-SPAN, was attended by representatives from various competing broadcast companies. The representatives challenged the merger deal, and some speakers were openly hostile to Karmazin and to satellite radio in general, while other speakers were more civil.
 Several times during the debate, the discussion centered on the failed merger deal between the two satellite television networks DirecTV and Echostar. The comparison between this proposed radio merger and the failed television merger was settled to some extent with an understanding that nearly all television viewers now use either cable or satellite to view available programming. Televised programming content is now delivered mainly in the form of a subscription, rather than airwave transmissions.
 Unlike television programming, most radio listeners use over the air receivers to listen to free programming content supported advertisers.
 ""We come to this hearing with an open mind, but we recognize that the companies have the obligation to convince the Congress, the regulators, and most importantly, the American People that this combination will improve the competitive playing field and benefit consumers,"" said John Conyers, the sub-committee chairman. To determine the legality of this merger, Congress first needs to decide whether a combined XM and Sirius would be a monopoly, as the only satellite radio provider in the United States, or whether the new company will actually be in competition with other forms of radio-like entertainment, according to Conyers. The hearing focused on alternatives such as Internet radio, terrestrial radio, portable audio devices, and emerging services, such as cell phone services and WiMax.
 At the heart of the debate is whether the two competing satellite services could drive each other to improve both of their services, or whether the proposed merger could result in end-user cost reductions by making more money available for Research & Development, new content, and subscription price reductions.
 David Rehr, president of the National Association of Broadcasters, spoke first. In a speech riddled with loaded terms like ""government sanctioned monopoly"" and ""government bailout"", he laid out points:
 Rerh accused Sirius and XM of breaking promises and asserted that neither company can be trusted. To trust the new, combined company would be stupid, he alleged.
 Gigi Sohn of Public Knowledge presented a more balanced view. On one hand, consolidation will raise questions about price and choice. On the other hand, XM and Sirius have engaged in a spending war, harming both companies financially. She also proposed conditions to protect consumer choice, such as public radio and educational programming requirements. Touching on the Recording Industry Association of America lawsuit, she also stated that consumers should be allowed to record programming.
 Mark Cooper spoke on behalf of the Consumer Federation of America. ""We have not given up on competition,"" Cooper said. Like David Rehr, he pointed out the restriction by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) against merging the two licenses. He believed the distinction between satellite and terrestrial radio makes satellite a unique market, where satellite radio is mobile and nationwide, and is not content-regulated. He also touched on the conditions of entry into the FCC market, ""Four is few and six is many, we only have two in this market.""
 Cooper also brought up ""inter-modal competition"" (competition between services that offer similar, but not the same products.) According to him, inter-modal competition has a poor track record of keeping down costs and increasing product quality. 
 Cooper was extremely outspoken against a ""regulated monopoly"", and said ""consumers are better served by competition.""
 Charles Biggio has a history in anti-trust regulation. He advocating finding more facts regarding the merger. His argument focused around Section 7 of the Clayton Act (see section 18.) Unlike other speakers, he did not have an agenda to pursue, but rather spoke specifically on government regulations.
 Mel Karmazin spoke on behalf of both XM and Sirius. Karmazin made several points and promises:
 Howard Berman (D-California 28th District) made a profound remark: ""As I listen to Mr. Rehr's testimony, and when he was talking about merged entities that controlled many radio markets, I thought for a second he was talking about ClearChannel."" The media company ClearChannel holds a considerable stake in the broadcast bandwidth in the United States.
 House Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) asked about diversity, wondering how the new company would create opportunites for minority ownership and minority involvement in the company's broadcasting? 
 Karmazin responded that Sirius and XM have several channels aimed at the African American community: music, entertainment, and talk channels. He noted that each network also carries Spanish-language channels. 
 To the impression that the combined stations would provide for minority-oriented programming, Karmazin explained that news and talk feeds were simply picked up from existing TV and radio networks, which left Rep Lee apparently unconvinced that their interests would be served.
 As a debate, this session did not definitevly resolve any issues, and more debate will be necessary. However, it did reveal some interesting facts and motivations:
 The merger faces more lobbying and politicizing of this issue as the proposal moves forward.

"," A 68–31 vote by the United States Senate confirmed Sonia Sotomayor to the United States Supreme Court this afternoon.
 Sotomayor, appointed to fill the seat vacated by Justice David Souter, is the first Latina woman, and third woman in history, to join the Supreme Court. The justice faced an easy confirmation in a senate controlled by the Democrats; all 31 votes against her confirmation came from Republicans. Two major controversies were raised during the confirmation hearings: the propriety of Sotomayor's comments while a circuit court judge in which she spoke of herself as a ""wise Latina"", better able to make fair judgments than a white male, raised objections from conservative Republicans over accusations of bias; while the overturning by the Supreme Court of Sotomayor's decision in Ricci v. DeStefano led others to question whether the justice was of a legal caliber sufficient to sit on the Supreme Court.
 Sotomayor nevertheless accumulated endorsements from both sides of the aisle, with nine Republicans, including South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, voting with the Democrats to accept Barack Obama's first Supreme Court nominee.
 The retirement of Souter and his replacement with Sotomayor will not shift the ideological balance of the Supreme Court, with Sotomayor likely to join Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer as part of the court's informal liberal wing.

"," U.S.-based credit rating agency Standard & Poor's (S&P) announced Monday its decision to downgrade its outlook for the U.S. long-term debt from ""stable"" to ""negative"", saying it is not confident the U.S. Congress and Obama administration will be able to reach an agreement to meaningfully cut the country's fast-growing budget deficit within a two-year framework. 
 Although the U.S. continues to have a top AAA credit rating at the moment, S&P says that there is at least a 33 percent possibility it will lower the country's long-term bond rating within the next two years. The U.S. now has $1.4 trillion budget deficit and a $14.27 trillion debt burden. Currently, payments and interest on the debt consume more than 60 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product with the amount only expected to grow. 
 The Treasury Department predicts the country will reach its $14.29 trillion legal debt limit as early as May 16. Congress must vote to raise the debt limit within the next few weeks, or risk defaulting on debt payments. The Obama administration has said that failure to raise the debt limit will have a disastrous effect on the economy.
 Last year, President Obama appointed a debt commission which produced a plan for cutting the country's budget by $3.8 trillion, over ten years, through spending reductions and tax increases. Currently, a bipartisan group of Republicans and Democrats are trying to reach a compromise over this plan. But, negotiations are currently deadlocked. Congress has failed to produce a budget for fiscal year 2011, the first time it has failed to produce a budget in 36 years, leaving  the various appropriation committees no budgetary guidelines to follow.  
 S&P said, ""Because the U.S. has, relative to its AAA peers, what we consider to be very large budget deficits and rising government indebtedness, and the path to addressing these is not clear to us, we have revised our outlook on the long-term rating to negative from stable.""
 A decrease in the nation's credit rating would make it more difficult for it to borrow money, and the money it is able to borrow would come at a higher interest rate, further increasing the national debt. The U.S. currently borrows 41 cents of every dollar it spends, according to a report released by the U.S. House of Representatives on January 19.
 Last week, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said the U.S. deficit was causing financial instability around the world. The U.S. stock market closed down 1.5 percent, with trading volume 2.3 percent lower on Monday in light of the announcement.

He defeated real estate agent Steve Kraus, 51 percent to 48 percent, and will now face incumbent Democratic Representative Marcy Kaptur, who has held the seat since 1983.
 Wurzelbacher received notice during the 2008 presidential election, when he asked a question about taxes to future president Barack Obama. Obama, who at the time was the Democratic Party presidential nominee, famously responded, ""when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody."" After this, Republican presidential nominee John McCain used Wurzelbacher as a representation of the average American worker, and attacked Obama's response as socialist.
 Following the exchange, students from the University of Massachusetts tried to draft Wurzelbacher to run against Kaptur in the 2010 congressional race, calling on him to ""Plunge the crap out of Washington."" He initially expressed interest, but at that time did not run. In 2011, though, he announced his candidacy for 2012. 
 In the Republican primary, Wurzelbacher out-raised his opponent $60,000 to $10,000 and benefited from the endorsement of former 2012 Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain. Wurzelbacher said of partisanship, ""Democrat, Republican...it's something that the media uses to try to divide us as Americans...I'm not working for the Republican Party or Republicans, I'm working for the American people, and that includes all of us.""
 In the Democratic primary, Kaptur defeated Representative Dennis Kucinich, who challenged her after his district was redrawn. Kaptur argues that Wurzelbacher is ""going to have his own issues dealing with the electorate as he moves forward...I think the nature of the District is quite different than his value set.""
 Wurzelbacher concedes that he lives in a largely Democratic and pro-Union community, but says the people are ""all really good friends of mine...we agree on a lot of things, and ultimately what it comes down to [is] we want jobs, we want security, we want stability.""

"," Susan G. Komen for the Cure has announced it will continue to fund breast cancer screening and educational programming on breast health run by fellow US-charity Planned Parenthood and its affiliates. This news comes shortly after Komen announced it would cut funding to Planned Parenthood due to an ongoing investigation.
 Komen has changed its internal criteria for grant funding. Previously, it would not support any organization under investigation of any kind; now it says it will only cut support if the investigation involved is ""criminal and conclusive"". The old criteria disqualified Planned Parenthood because it was under investigation by United States House Energy Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Chairman Representative Cliff Stearns.
 In a statement on Komen's website, the Board of Directors and founder Nancy G. Brinker wrote, ""We want to apologize to the American public for recent decisions that cast doubt upon our commitment to our mission of saving women’s lives. The events of this week have been deeply unsettling for our supporters, partners and friends and all of us at Susan G. Komen.  We have been distressed at the presumption that the changes made to our funding criteria were done for political reasons or to specifically penalize Planned Parenthood.  They were not.""
 Planned Parenthood said in response to the restoration of Komen's funding, it was ""enormously grateful"".
 Since the cuts were announced, Planned Parenthood gained $3 million (€2.3m, £1.9m) in donations and 10,000 new Facebook likes. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg personally pledged $250,000 (€190k, £158k). 26 US Senators signed a public letter to the charity; in it they said, ""It would be tragic if any woman — let alone thousands of women — lost access to these potentially lifesaving screenings because of a politically motivated attack.""

"," Susan G. Komen for the Cure has stopped funding breast cancer screening and educational programming on breast health run by fellow US-charity Planned Parenthood and its affiliates. The Komen institute cites an ongoing investigation, while Planned Parenthood blame political pressures.
 Planned Parenthood received nearly $700,000 from the Komen Foundation last year alone. In the last five years, the funding from the foundation has granted 170,000 women breast exams.   
 Leslie Aun, a spokesperson for the Komen Foundation, said the organization adopted a new rule that does not allow grants or funding to be awarded to organizations that are under legal investigation. Komen's policy disqualified Planned Parenthood due to a pending investigation on how Planned Parenthood spends and reports its money that is being conducted by Representative Cliff Stearns. Stearns is investigating whether taxes are used to fund abortions through Planned Parenthood in his role as chairman of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, which is under the umbrella of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
 ""While it is regrettable when changes in priorities and policies affect any of our grantees, such as a longstanding partner like Planned Parenthood, we must continue to evolve to best meet the needs of the women we serve and most fully advance our mission,"" Aun said.
 Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, said, ""While this is deeply disturbing and disappointing, we want to assure women who rely on Planned Parenthood for breast care that we're still here for them, and we always will be.

397," Thursday, July 1, 2010 "," The US House of Representatives passed a significant overhaul of financial regulations that strengthens the government's hold on banks and also creates a new federal agency to oversee consumer lending on Wednesday.
 ""Never again, never again should Wall Street greed bring such suffering to our country,"" said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-MD after the bill was passed by the House.
 The House vote, which was mainly split over party lines, had 237 representatives in favor and 192 opposed. Only three Republicans voted for the bill, though this was an increase from December, when no Republicans voted for the previous version of the bill. This new bill combines the old December bill with a newer one passed by the more conservative Senate last month.
 But even though the Senate passed their bill already, support for the one passed Wednesday looks a little uncertain. Since earlier this year the Democrats lost their 60 vote filibuster majority, they had to secure the votes of a few more moderate Republican senators to beat back procedural hurdles. Democrats struggled to win the full support of these senators even after backing down on a US$19 billion tax on big banks and hedge funds, which had been opposed by Republicans. This group of senators includes Scott Brown, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins. All three voted for the Senate bill last month.
 The $19 billion tax was inserted in the 2000 page plus bill late last week, which came as a surprise to many large banks. Brown initially objected to the tax, and threatened to vote against the entire bill if the tax was not removed. Instead, the new way of financing the bill's cost will be using $11 billion in cash that came from ending the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a bill passed in 2008 that bailed out struggling banks, and also by increasing rates that banks pay to insure bank deposits to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. However, the increase in rates won't affect banks with assets of less then $10 billion. 
 On Wednesday, Collins wrote a statement saying that she now planned to vote for the bill. However, Brown remained on the fence and said he would use recess during the week of July 4th to examine the details of the bill. He credited Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd for ""thinking outside the box"" in coming with a new way to fund the bill.
 Other Republicans were much more opposed to the bill, and attacked it for failing to place tighter restrictions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants that helped trigger the economic and housing meltdowns. House Republican leader John Boehner compared the new bill to using a nuclear weapon on an ant. In response, President Barack Obama said in a speech in Racine, Wisconsin that ""[i]f the Republican leader is that out of touch with the struggles facing the American people, he should come here to Racine and ask people if they think the financial crisis was an ant.""

 The Republican O'Donnell will likely face Democrat Christopher A. Coons in a special election on November 2. The Senate seat from Delaware was vacated when Joe Biden became Vice-President of the United States in January 2009, and interim appointee Ted Kaufman declined to run for the seat. Analysts such as Taegan Goddard and Bill Kristol question whether O'Donnell can defeat Coons in November. Before the nominations for the race opened, Mike Castle had been favored to win the seat, which would be a Republican gain in the now Democratic-controlled Senate.
 Former Alaska governor and Republican Vice-Presidential nominee Sarah Palin endorsed O'Donnell late in the race. The Tea Party movement presents itself as a constructionist conservative movement seeking to reclaim the Republican Party from established politicians.

Craig McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice, said that ""for a new grand jury to indict DeLay on a day's notice suggests the evidence of his participation is convincing.""

"," As Tom DeLay's (Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Texas), alleged ethical lapses began to dominate American political news stories and the Sunday talk shows, have led some Republican members of the Majority Leader’s own party to question the reasoning for his refusal to account for his actions or resign.
 Last year, in a glimpse of problems yet to surface, the Republican head of the U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, or ""House Ethics Committee"", presided over three admonitions that included offering to endorse the candidacy of a political lawmaker’s son in exchange for votes on legislation.  The ethics complaints were originally filed by Democratic Rep. Chris Bell of Texas on June 15, 2004, and began to heat up in the months prior to last year's elections.
 A Texas grand jury is taking a hard look at Delay’s fund raising practices, and has already indicted three of his close associates. Last week the Washington Post reported that Mr. DeLay took a trip to Moscow in 1997, financed by lobbyists of the Russian Government.
 Delay’s representative, Dan Allen, told reporters ""Congressman DeLay's effective leadership to build and strengthen the House majority is exactly the reason he is being targeted by liberal groups funded by George Soros.""
 But Christopher Shays, a Republican from Connecticut, a Republican moderate, told the Associated Press that DeLay’s ""conduct is hurting the Republican Party"" and ""hurting any Republican who is up for re-election [in 2006].""
 The news agency reported that DeLay would look forward to meeting the charges with the ethics committee in a sit-down and blamed all of his problems on House Democrats.
 Senator Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, advised his Republican colleagues strongly to “Be careful about how closely you embrace Mr. DeLay, as long as he's there, he's going to become a pretty good target."" His remarks were nationally televised on ABC TV.
 Those Republicans working with the Majority Leader said his ethics are only a problem to Democrats trying to regain power in the House. But the Ethics Committee’s membership is equally divided between Republicans and Democrats.
 Other Republicans are starting to get jittery about their reelection hopes if DeLay is allowed to retain power.
 ""Tom's conduct is hurting the Republican Party, is hurting this Republican majority and it is hurting any Republican who is up for re-election,"" Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., told the Associated Press after making similar comments at community meetings in his home district this weekend.
 He told reporters he thinks DeLay should step down.
 The third-ranking Republican in the Senate, Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, said DeLay needs to “clear the air.” But he thinks everything done by DeLay was “according to the law.”
 ""I think he has to come forward and lay out what he did and why he did it and let the people then judge for themselves,"" he said on ABC's This Week,  a Sunday political talk program. ""Now you may not like some of the things he's done, that’s for the people of his district to decide, whether they want to approve that kind of behavior.""
 Santorum faces reelection in 2006.
 DeLay is under investigation by the Travis County (Texas) district attorney, Democrat Ronnie Earle, who has already indicted three members of DeLay's organization, Texans for a Republican Majority Political Action Committee (TRMPAC), on charges of money laundering and accepting illegal campaign contributions. 
 DeLay and his associates are alleged to have created a front group to launder money obtained through this illegal method.  The District attorney believes he is enforcing the law enacted by the Texas lawmakers.
 DeLay and his supporters contended that this investigation and the indictments were politically motivated maneuvers by the Democratic Travis County, Texas District Attorney Ronnie Earle. Earle has been characterized as a controversial and colorful political figure with a history of pursuing unconventional indictments against elected officials including Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison. However, his record shows that he has indicted more Democrats than Republicans.
 Federal investigators are probing a lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, another DeLay associate, for bilking millions of dollars from Native American casino operators for promises of congressional action to support their businesses. Abramoff and others may have underwritten overseas travel for the Majority Leader, which is a violation of law.
 DeLay has taken on the nation’s independent judiciary, particularly those who disagreed with him on the reinsertion of the feeding tube for Terri Schiavo, a brain damaged Florida woman who died on March 31. Reports that he pulled the life support from his own father, when he was fatally injured in the 1980’s, didn’t deter him.
 ""The time will come for the men responsible for this to answer for their behavior,"" DeLay said of the judges.
 Asked what his associates think of DeLay’s latest slew of bad news, spokesman Dan Allen replied, ""Members were very supportive through the week last week and going into the weekend.""
 The Bush administration said that DeLay has not become the political liability that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, became in 2002.
 Both Chris Shays and Joel Hefley, a Republican from Colorado, the past chairman of the House ethics committee who sanctioned DeLay three times, have signed a resolution, crafted by Democrats, that would end some of the rules changes that their own party pushed through to help DeLay only three months ago. DeLay voted for the changes to cover his actions as well.
 Hefley said ""A lot of folks mention quietly that they are concerned about it. On the other hand, you have a lot of members standing up and pledging their undying support for Mr. DeLay,""
 Eleven years after the Republicans swept power in the Congress from the Democrats, they seem more intent on protecting DeLay than keeping the “Contract with America,” according to critics. They say “that is the corrupting influence of power.”
 DeWayne Wickham of USA Today asks, “How will voters respond to this breach of the Contract?” The next federal elections will take place in November of 2006.

 In an interview on Monday, April 3, 2006, DeLay spoke with Time Magazine's White House correspondent Mike Allen, revealing his plans to give up his bid for re-election to the House seat representing the 22nd District in Texas.  In addition, DeLay said that he plans to leave Congress in the next few months, though he has not yet decided on the date.
 DeLay's office released a taped statement to media outlets on April 4, 2006 that addressed his decision to resign from Congress.  ""I will make that resignation effective sometime before mid-June, but largely dependent on the congressional calendar.  I plan to begin focusing on the next phase of my life as a private citizen.""  DeLay's statement points to ""negative, personal campaign[ing]"" by ""liberal Democrats"" as a reason behind his resignation.  He plans to determine ""new ways from various arenas outside of public office that will allow me to continue to contribute to and engage in the policy, political, and cultural issues of national importance to the conservative majority.""  DeLay will be moving from Texas to his property in Virginia in order to be closer to Washington, DC. 
 DeLay has served in Congress for 11 terms.  He temporarily gave up his seat as House Majority leader in 2005 after he was indicted in Texas on money laundering charges and then permanently relinquished his House leadership position in January 2006.  DeLay has allegedly been linked to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who in January 2006 entered a guilty plea to charges of conspiracy to corrupt public officials, mail fraud, and tax evasion.

 Loughner has been charged in federal court with attempted assassination of a member of Congress, first-degree murder and attempting to kill employees of the federal government. Prosecutors for the State of Arizona are trying to determine whether they can bring charges for the other killings and attempted killings in state court.
 Loughner confirmed his identity to the court and was denied bail but did not enter a plea. He stated that he understood the potential punishment for the charges include the death penalty or life imprisonment. He is being represented by Judy Clarke, who has previously defended Theodore Kaczynski (the 'Unabomber') and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.
 Surgeons have had to perform emergency surgery on Giffords, including a hemicraniectomy, which involves removing a large section of her skull to reduce the pressure from the swelling in the brain caused by the gunshot wound. Dr. Michael Lemole, one neurosurgeon operating on Giffords said that she was ""not out of the woods yet"". He also noted that ""swelling can sometimes take three days or five days to maximize. But every day that goes by and we don't see an increase, we're slightly more optimistic."" Giffords has been able to respond to basic commands from doctors like holding up two fingers.
 Meanwhile, debates rage following allegations that Loughner had a political basis for his attack. Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik blamed some extreme rhetoric in the media.

"," According to senior defense officials, U.S. service men and women around the world, including those at war in Iraq and Afghanistan, may receive only one-week's pay instead of two in their next paycheck if the government shuts down this weekend due to the federal budget impasse.
 The military can't be paid during a funding lapse until a new appropriations bill or continuing resolution is passed by Congress.
 If the funding bill is allowed to expire on April 8, it will be in the middle of a standard military two-week pay period, so the Pentagon would likely send out paychecks for just the first week of the pay period, and not the second, leaving many service members strapped for cash for the remainder of the month.
 Historically, workers such as the military who are legally obligated to work during a shutdown, do eventually receive back pay for it. But that doesn't help pay bills that are due presently.
 Additional details on the military's plan for funding during a potential shutdown are expected in the next day or so.
 Pentagon press secretary Geoff Morrell said earlier Tuesday that department leaders hadn't figured out how pay would be affected for the military, including the 146,000 servicemembers in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Morrell said the Pentagon would continue key national security responsibilities including fighting the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, and continuing operations in Libya and earthquake assistance to Japan.
 The likelihood of a shutdown continues to increase, and President Obama continues to reject a Republican measure that would fund the government for another week but cut $12 billion from the budget.

The bill is co-sponsored by 20 senators, and the House of Representatives is considering a companion measure, H.R. 874, introduced by Representatives Bill Delahunt and Jeff Flake. The House measure has 121 cosponsors.
 Senator Dick Lugar, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, spoke in favor of the bill, saying that the United States' embargo on Cuba had ""failed to achieve its stated purpose of bringing democracy to the Cuban people.""
 Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat and a second generation Cuban-American, opposes the bill, arguing that free travel by Europeans, Canadians and the citizens of other Latin American countries has not helped to democratize the island nation. ""The regime has not opened up,"" said Sen. Menendez. ""On the contrary, it has used resources to become more oppressive.""

 Speaker Boehner announced the agreement in a brief statement: ""Senator Reid and I have reached an agreement that will ensure taxes do not increase for working families on January 1"". Boehner informed other congressmen of the deal in a conference call yesterday evening.
 The House may pass the bill via unanimous consent today, which would not require the presence of all members. Boehner and Reid also agreed to a bipartisan negotiation committee to sort out differences and extend the tax cut for an entire year, a goal recently sought by Republicans in the House.
 The extension of the payroll tax cut, which would prevent approximately 160 million Americans from seeing a tax increase in 2012, had already been passed by the Senate last weekend. Earlier yesterday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell joined several other Republican Senators in encouraging the House to pass the extension.

This is the right thing to do to strengthen our families, grow our economy, and create new jobs. This is real money that will make a real difference in people's lives.""

U.S. Representative Thaddeus McCotter of Livonia, Michigan decided Saturday not to wage a write-in campaign to seek the Republican Party nomination for his seat, despite a contrary announcement last week. McCotter admitted that he could not oversee such a campaign while simultaneously serving in Congress and assisting with a state investigation into his failed ballot petition.
 McCotter, who has represented Michigan's 11th congressional district since 2003, made history when he became the first sitting congressman in modern times to be denied a spot on his party's district primary ballot. This occurred after his campaign submitted a petition that fell short of the required 1,000 valid signatures. 
 Though the submission listed 2,000 signatures, the Michigan Secretary of State deemed only 244 to be valid. The Detroit News's review of the submission noted duplicate signatures, evidence of photocopying, and signatures seemingly cut and pasted from previous sources.  McCotter speculated, ""somebody either panicked or it was sabotage...My gut tells me that we got lied to by someone we trusted.""
 Afterwards, McCotter wrote an op-ed for The Detroit News announcing the formation of a write-in campaign and taking responsibility for the failed petition, arguing ""you clean up your own mess."" Now, citing other responsibilities, he countered his previous point in that ""one can’t clean up a mess multitasking."" He now wishes to identify ""the person or persons who concocted the fraudulent petitions that have cost me so dearly."" The decision effectively ends his career in Congress for now.
 The development comes as former State Senator Loren Bennett announced Friday that he would mount a write-in campaign for the seat's Republican nomination. He challenges teacher Kerry Bentivolio, who will be the only candidate listed on the August 7 primary ballot. Others are expected to announce write-in campaigns before the filing deadline on July 27.
 Though the district is considered safe for Republicans, the turn of events may work to the benefit of Democrats. Canton Township trustee Syed Taj and LaRouche movement activist William Roberts are the only candidates listed for the district's Democratic primary.
 McCotter, who briefly sought the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, won re-election in 2010, 58 percent to 39 percent over his Democratic challenger.

As a result, McCotter announced yesterday in a The Detroit News editorial that he will wage a write-in campaign to secure his party's nomination.
 Since 2003, McCotter has represented the 11th district, being re-elected four times. He briefly sought the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nomination before dropping out last September, when he announced he would re-focus his efforts on his fifth congressional re-election bid. 
 In May, the McCotter campaign submitted a petition of 2,000 signatures to place McCotter on the Republican Party primary ballot; only 1,000 were necessary.  Nevertheless, only 244 of the signatures presented were deemed valid. 
 Reviewing the submission, The Detroit News found that some signatures were photocopied onto the petition, some duplicated, and others appeared to be cut and pasted from previous petitions. Director for the Bureau of Elections Christopher Thomas described the situation as ""unprecedented"" and the matter has been turned over to the office of the Michigan Attorney General for a possible investigation of fraud.
 In an interview with the Detroit Free Press, McCotter speculated that ""Somebody either panicked or it was sabotage...My gut tells me that we got lied to by someone we trusted."" He supports an investigation, but has taken responsibility for what happened.
 In his write-in campaign announcement, laden with pop cultural references, McCotter admitted, ""Yes, a write-in campaign is a difficult hill to climb but, as I am responsible for the hill, I will climb it to the utmost of my ability."" According to Inside Michigan Politics editor Bill Ballenger, McCotter is the first sitting Congressman to not qualify for his party's primary ballot in the last fifty years.
 Kerry Bentivolio, a former teacher from Milford, Michigan, will be the only candidate listed on the Republican primary ballot. In order to vote for McCotter, voters will have to manually write in his name. He says that to win this way requires ""groundwork — the people-to-people, door-to-door and personal networking so that voters know they have to take that extra step.""

"," U.S. House of Representatives majority leader Tom DeLay was today indicted in Austin, Texas by a Travis County grand jury on conspiracy charges. DeLay announced that he will step down temporarily from his leadership position. 
 DeLay has publicly countered that the charges are partisan and thus politically motivated.  The charges  originate from the District Attorney of Travis County, Ronnie Earle, a Democrat who has prosecuted Democrat and Republican office holders, including U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. [1]
 Mr. DeLay's attorney Steve Brittain said that DeLay was accused of a criminal conspiracy in a campaign finance scheme along with two associates, namely John Colyandro, former executive director of a Texas political action committee formed by DeLay, and Jim Ellis, the head of DeLay's national political committee. 
 Attorneys for Colyandro and Ellis have filed to have the proceedings moved out of Travis County in order to obtain a fair trial. [2] Travis County, located in central Texas, contains the state capital of Austin and is politically known as a liberal county within a conservative state, as indicated by the most recent presidential elections.
 According to the indictment, ""the defendants herein, with the intent that a felony be committed, did enter into an agreement with one or more of each other with a general purpose committee known as Texans for a Republican Majority PAC (political action committee) that one or more of them would engage in conduct that would constitute the offense of knowingly making a political contribution in violation of Subchapter D of Chapter 253 of the Texas Election Code...""  The indictment does not include specific charges of how DeLay was involved in the conspiracy.  Mr. DeLay waived a three-year restriction for the indictment.
 Mr. DeLay, upon announcement of the indictment, made a solitary public comment: ""I have notified the speaker that I will temporarily step aside from my position as majority leader pursuant to rules of the House Republican Conference and the actions of the Travis County district attorney today."" 
 Earlier, DeLay denied all charges in the lengthy investigation. Bill White, another of DeLay's attorneys, said ""it's a skunky indictment if they have one."" DeLay's spokesman, Kevin Madden, called the indictment ""nothing more than prosecutorial retribution by a partisan Democrat,"" referring to prosecutor Ronnie Earle, a Democrat.
 According to House Republican party rules, DeLay must resign upon indictment. Party officials told the Associated Press that Speaker of the House, Dennis Hastert R-Illinois, will likely recommend Republican David Dreier of California as replacement, while some duties may also go to Majority whip Roy Blunt, R-Missouri. 
 DeLay has previously been admonished three times by the House Ethics Committee. In their October 6, 2004 letter to him, the members wrote in part concluding, ""...it is clearly necessary for you to temper your future actions to assure that you are in full compliance at all times with the applicable House Rules and standards of conduct. We remind you that the House Code of Official Conduct provides the Committee with authority “to deal with any given act or accumulation of acts which, in the judgment of the committee, are severe enough to reflect discredit on the Congress.” [3]
 House Republicans earlier eliminated the rule requiring his resignation upon indictment, but reinstated it fearing voters' outcry.
 DeLay's Political Action Committee, Texans for a Republican Majority, was earlier indicted on charges it accepted corporate contributions mostly from the credit card industry .[4] for use in state legislative elections. Texas law prohibits corporate money from being used in elections, permitting it only for administrative expenses. 
 Having gained GOP control of Texas's legislature, DeLay masterminded a redistricting plan in 2004 that allowed the GOP to gain six seats in the U.S. House, formerly won by Democrats, and build a majority in Congress. In one case, one lawmaker switched parties, to maintain office.

"," Yesterday, the United States House of Representatives voted to effectively reject the Senate version of a bill, passed with bipartisan support, to extend a payroll tax cut two months past its year-end expiration date. The House voted instead to create a conference committee to settle differences between members of both bodies.
 Although the tax cut extension itself has support among Republicans and Democrats, lawmakers disagree on how Congress should go about compensating for the cost of extending the cut and the policy changes it would entail.
 During an appearance yesterday, President Obama condemned opposition to the Senate-passed version of the bill, accusing Republicans in the House of trying to negotiate on matters unrelated to the bill. Republicans, in response, say there is still time to negotiate the bill, insisting that lawmakers ought to concentrate on a year-long plan rather than a two-month extension. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, however, says he will not agree to negotiate the tax cut extension until the Senate-approved bill is passed by the House.
 If the tax cut is not extended and instead expires on December 31, approximately 160 million Americans will be affected by the tax increase; President Obama insists the only way to prevent the tax hike beginning January 1 is for the House to pass the Senate bill. In response, House Speaker and Republican John Boehner wants Obama to ""call on the Senate to return"" to negotiate. The Senate, shortly after passing the bill, adjourned for the Holiday break.
 Also included in the bill is a provision that would require President Obama to make a decision regarding the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, a pipeline that would transport oil from Canada to Texas.
 House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi blamed the congressional year-end impasse on ""Tea Party Republicans."" In a letter to President Obama, Speaker Boehner requested he galvanize the Senate to negotiate on the bill's provisions, writing ""The differences between the two different bills can be quickly reconciled to provide the American people the certainty of a full-year bill. There are still 11 days before the end of the year, and with so many Americans struggling, there is no reason they should be wasted. You have said many times that Congress must do its work before taking vacation"".

 Minutes after the House adjourned, John Shadegg (R-AZ) began typing in random access codes to the House speaker system until he found one that worked. He then began talking about the urgent need for a new energy policy. The microphones were turned off again, but Shadegg called other Republicans onto the floor to initiate what C-SPAN called a ""post-adjournment session."" Some representatives were already going home when they received notice of the ""session"" and returned to the floor to speak about an offshore drilling bill which Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) had blocked from the schedule. There was no Speaker of the House or parliamentary procedure for the ""session""; Republican speakers were cheered on and Democrats were booed down, and Devin Nunes (R-CA) mocked the Democratic energy plan by parading an image of a Volkswagen Beetle with a sail on the top around the chambers. Republicans sent pages back to the House office buildings to look for a megaphone.
 Democratic leaders expelled journalists from the Hall of the House, first from the Speaker's Lobby, then from the third floor press gallery in order to minimize coverage of the political theater. In response, Republican representatives walked into the quickly filling visitors' galleries, shaking hands and talking with tourists and interns. Democrats twice turned off the lights, eliciting cheers. The sound system and official cameras were also shut off early in the afternoon.
 At 4:29PM Wikinews correspondent Shii arrived on the House floor but quickly discovered that no cameras were allowed inside the visitors' galleries, and the galleries were being closed by the Capitol Police. The scene was orderly but noisy, as scores of visitors cheered and applauded the Republicans before being escorted out of the galleries by the police. The only people remaining on the floor at that point were the Republicans, who left the room to speak to reporters, and the visitors and staff they had invited onto the floor as guests.
 John Culberson (R-TX) circumvented the ban on cameras inside the House by using his Blackberry to send Twitter messages to his microblog and recording brief snippets of video with his digital camera. (One Twitter user noted that this was a violation of House communications rules.) At a press conference outside the House floor, Culberson showed off his Blackberry and camera, accompanied by brief, improvised speeches by other House Republicans.
 ""Nancy Pelosi, we want a vote!"" demanded Wally Herger (R-CA). The Republicans then returned to the floor, even though all the galleries were closed.

414," Friday, July 22, 2005 "," The U.S. House of Representatives voted Thursday night to renew several provisions of the Patriot Act which was established after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The final vote was 257-171, this now makes 14 of the 16 original provisions of the Patriot Act permanent and will extend the other two for an additional 10 years.
 The two provisions which were only extended for 10 years have been called unconstitutional by some civil liberties advocates as well as several law makers from both the right and left. They say that the provisions give law enforcement ""sweeping powers"" that could be abused. However, President Bush as well as several Republican and Democratic members of Congress say that the provisions have been used judiciously and provide key tools needed to fight terrorism.
 House lawmakers widely viewed the uncontroversial provisions of the Patriot Act as breaking down ""the wall"" that was a barrier to communication and cooperation between FBI and CIA agencies. The two provisions which received 10-year extensions were concerned with allowing roving wiretaps, and the other with allowing searches of library and medical records. In a pre-vote Q & A, U.S. federal attorney Paul McNulty explained that a federal search in those intrusive situations require independent federal judge approval, which is granted under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in Section 215.
 The U.S. Senate's  reauthorization of the Patriot Act has differences from the House version. Both bills head to conference committee to be combined into one cohesive law.
 In a Wednesday morning address to a gathering at the Port of Baltimore, in Maryland, President Bush called on congress for passage of the act: ""The Patriot Act is expected to expire, but the terrorist threats will not expire. I expect, and the American people expect, the United States Congress and the United States Senate to renew the Patriot Act, without weakening our ability to fight terror, and they need to get that bill to my desk soon.""

Fiscal conservatives in the Senate blocked the measure, fearing it could increase administrative costs. Supporters insist any additional costs would be negligible. The President's action has met with bipartisan support from within the swing state of Colorado; although national Republican leaders have criticised presidential use of the 1906 act, citing concerns that where mineral, or fossil fuel, resources may be present such action ""locks them up"".

 The second, H.RES.636, calls for Censuring President George W. Bush for failing to respond to requests for information concerning allegations that he and others in his Administration misled Congress and the American people regarding the decision to go to war in Iraq, misstated and manipulated intelligence information regarding the justification for the war, countenanced torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment of persons in Iraq, and permitted inappropriate retaliation against critics of his Administration, for failing to adequately account for specific misstatements he made regarding the war, and for failing to comply with Executive Order 12958.

"," The U.S. Senate passed a revised bailout bill designed to help the struggling U.S. financial economy, which has measures nearly identical to the bill rejected by the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday.
 ""Senate Democrats and Republicans believe it is essential that we work quickly on this important legislation to restore confidence to our financial system and strengthen the economy,"" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.
 The new revisions include raising the FDIC insurance cap to $250,000, a move designed to please progressives. However, the $110 billion in tax breaks, earmarks and what has been called pork barrel spending is not offset by any increases in revenues and has added opposition to the bill from some Representatives in the House.
 Earmarks added into the bailout bill included $192 million in tax rebates for the Virgin Islands rum industry, $148 million in tax cuts for the wool industry, $100 million tax cuts to the auto racing industry, and $48 million in Hollywood tax incentives. 
 Vice President of Taxpayers for Common Sense, Steve Ellis, offered his explanation for the pork and earmarks added in. ""People who support some of these provisions will forget about the $700 billion and concerns they may have on that, and say, 'If you give me a few million in tax breaks for my constituents, I'll go along'"".
 The tactic seems to have worked, however, managing to flip enough votes to pass the bill.
 ""The inclusion of parity, tax extenders and the FDIC increases has caused me to reconsider my position,"" said Representative Jim Ramstad (R Minnesota), who voted against the previous bill on Monday. ""All three additions have greatly improved the bill.""
 But Representative Marcy Kaptur (D Ohio) was not changing her no vote. ""I will not support this legislation because it's the wrong medicine,"" she said.
 The Senate took H.R.1424, a bill originating in the House concerning ""equity in the provision of mental health and substance-related disorder benefits under group health plans, to prohibit discrimination on the basis of genetic information with respect to health insurance and employment,"" and extended it with the bailout provisions.
 H.R.1424 was introduced on March 9, 2007, by Rep. Patrick Kennedy (RI-1) and had the support of First Lady Rosalind Carter.  It is noted on the Congressional Website that ""On 10/1/2008, the Senate passed H.R.1424 as the vehicle for the economic rescue legislation. In the EAS version of the bill (Engrossed Amendment as Agreed to by the Senate), Division A (pp.1-110) is referred to as the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008; Division B (pp. 110-255) is referred to as the Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008; and Division C (pp. 255-441) is referred to as the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act of 2008.""  It was not treated as an appropriations bill in the House.
 There were two votes in the Senate. The first was to amend H.R.1424, which required 3/5 to be accepted, which it was.  The second was a vote on the bill. Passage of the Bill required only a 1/2 majority. It was passed with 74 yeas and 25 nays.  Senator Kennedy did not vote.

"," After several weeks of at times contentious deliberation in the Senate Judiciary Committee, the United States Senate confirmed Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr. to the Supreme Court with 58 votes in favor and 42 against. Only one Republican, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, voted against confirmation.  Four Democrats, including former Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia, voted for confirmation. Alito was sworn-in later in the day.
 Alito had been nominated by President George W. Bush following the withdrawal of his original Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers, a criminal lawyer and close associate of Bush since before his tenure as Governor of Texas from 1994-2000. Miers, facing harsh criticism of her qualifications for a position on the high court, along with growing opposition from members of the conservative movement, elected to withdraw in October 2005. 
 Alito was nominated shortly after Miers' withdrawal, and faced the Judiciary Committee in January 2006. 
 With the  Bush Administration facing poor approval ratings following the withdrawal of Miers, Senate Democrats put forth a strong offensive to the confirmation of Alito. They questioned Alito extensively of his record on abortion, exercise of executive authority, his opinions on various legal issues while studying at Princeton University and his membership in the CAP group there.
 Following the Judiciary Committee's party-line vote approving Alito, efforts were spearheaded by ranking Judiciary Committee member Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA) and Sen. John F. Kerry (D-MA) to filibuster Alito's confirmation. However, the motion to end debate on Alito ended with a 72-25 cloture vote; Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) acknowledged that a filibuster was not a realistic option to stop Alito's confirmation.
 Alito is the second judge to be appointed and confirmed to the Supreme Court by President Bush. His first appointee, Judge John Roberts, was confirmed by the Senate in the autumn of 2005. Following the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Roberts was immediately selected to fill Rehnquist's post. 
 Alito will be replacing Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who was a crucial swing vote in an ideologically divided Court. With the appointment of Alito, the Court will most likely experience a shift to the political right. How much of a shift cannot be precisely determined, as it remains to be seen how Alito will rule in cases involving critical social issues.
 Alito earned a bachelor's degree in law from Princeton University, and did his graduate work at Yale Law School. Most of his bench experience has come at the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, where he has served as a justice since 1990, when President George H.W. Bush nominated him for the post. He follows current Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia as the second Italian-American member of the high court.
 Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) told the AP that the United States would ""be better and stronger and more unified if we were confirming a different nominee, a nominee who could have united us more than divided us"".
 Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) said he is concerned with Alito's ""philosophy of the Constitution [and] his great effort of many years to expand presidential power at a time when there are real serious questions about the powers the president has"".
 Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said there are no doubts about Alito's ""qualification in terms of education, professional career and his service on the court of appeals.""
 And in a written statement, President Bush called Alito a ""brilliant and fair-minded judge who strictly interprets the Constitution and laws and does not legislate from the bench. He is a man of deep character and integrity, and he will make all Americans proud as a Justice on our highest court.""

The bill fell 18 votes short of the 67 that were needed for approval.  In order for the bill to become part of the U.S. Constitution, this bill would have had to be approved by a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, then be approved by the legislatures of three fourths (that is, 38) of the States.

"," George Allen, incumbent Republican Senator from Virginia, conceded the state's mid-term election to Democratic challenger Jim Webb on Thursday. Democrats have now gained the six seats needed by the party to hold majority control of the Senate.
 ""The people of Virginia have spoken, they have spoken in a closely divided voice. We have two 49ers,"" Allen said during the afternoon press conference in Arlington. Allen garnered 49.25% of the vote, compared to the 49.55% who supported Webb. ""I do not wish to cause more rancor by protracted litigation that would not, in my opinion, alter the results.""
 The concession by Allen in traditionally Republican Virginia follows what were once prospects for an Allen 2008 presidential bid. An easy Allen re-election campaign to the Senate was expected, but what came was the Democrats ability to frame the election as a national referendum on the war in Iraq. Democrats may have succeeded nationally to draw on the issue of Iraq, but local politics were very much in play in Northern Virginia. 
 According to the Virginia Pilot, ""Unofficial returns gave Democratic nominee Webb a 120,000-vote advantage over Allen in Northern Virginia's eight localities. But Webb trailed badly across most of the rest of the state and would have decisively lost the election without his Northern Virginia support."" The margin by which Webb won was 9,000 votes.
 Allen's formulaic stance against tax increases, whether for highway taxes to improve congested northern highway and commuter corridors, or outright fiscal conservativism of all taxes in the face of a burgeoning national deficit, worked against him. 
 The state constitutional amendment banning recognition of same-sex marriage supported by Allen, but opposed by Webb and Governor Tim Kaine, and most Northern Virginians, worked against Allen in the election.

The vote will be followed by the difficult process of reconciling the Senate-passed bill with one approved by the House of Representatives, in order to get a final measure to President Barack Obama.
 ""The yeas are 60, the nays are 39. H.R. 3590 as amended, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is passed,"" Vice President Joe Biden announced. Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky did not show up for the vote leading to the 39 nays. Mike Reynard, a spokesman for Bunning, said in an e-mail that ""The senator had family commitments."" 
 The vice president presided over the Senate at the time of the vote in his role as President of the United States Senate.
 As expected, Republicans voted against the bill while all Democrats and two Independents, Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, voted for it.
 At an estimated $87 billion, the measure would expand health insurance coverage to about 30 million more Americans currently without it, and create new private insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, to expand choice.
 And, like the slightly more expensive measure passed by the House of Representatives, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, it would end a practice by private insurance companies of denying coverage to individuals with existing health problems. 
 Both the Senate and House measures would require nearly all Americans to purchase some form of insurance, while lower-income Americans would receive help from federal government subsidies.
 In remarks before the vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat from Nevada, said opponents had done everything they could to prevent the vote from taking place.
 Speaking to reporters, Reid and others hailed the vote as a victory and a major step toward providing millions more Americans with access to health care. ""This is a victory because we have affirmed that the ability to live a healthy life in our great country is a right and not merely a privilege for the select few,"" Reid said.
 Reid and others including Robert Byrd, the 92-year-old Democrat from West Virginia, paid tribute to Senator Edward Kennedy, who died this past August after spending decades of his career in the Senate pursuing health care reform.
 When casting his vote Byrd said, ""Mr. President, this is for my friend Ted Kennedy. Aye."" 
 Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Senator Kennedy, watched the proceedings from the Senate visitor's gallery, as did Representative John Dingell, Democrat from Michigan, who has been a long time advocate of health care reform and who sponsored and introduced the House version of the health care reform bill.
 In the final hours of debate on the Senate bill, Republicans asserted it would be ineffective and add sharply to the U.S. budget deficit.
 Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican from Alabama said of the bill, ""This legislation may have a great vision, it may have a great idea about trying to make the system work better. But it does not. These are huge costs [and] it's not financially sound.""
 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed to defeat the bill when the Senate reconvenes in January saying, ""This fight is not over. This fight is long from over. My colleagues and I will work to stop this bill from becoming law."" 
 Senator Olympia Snowe, a moderate Republican from Maine who helped approved the Senate Finance Committee's version of health care reform, the America's Healthy Future Act, earlier in the year and who remarked she may not vote on the final bill, said, ""I was extremely disappointed,"" noting that when the Democrats reached their needed 60 votes to overcome a filibuster, ""there was zero opportunity to amend the bill or modify it, and Democrats had no incentive to reach across the aisle."" 
 Ahead are difficult negotiations with the House of Representatives to craft a final bill President Obama would sign into law. These talks, which will formally get under way early in the new year, will take place amid anger among many liberal House Democrats the Senate bill failed to contain a government-run public health insurance option.
 Members of the House Progressive Caucus have vowed to fight to keep this public option in any final legislation that emerges, along with other provisions they say are needed to protect lower and middle-income Americans and hold insurance companies accountable.
 In a statement, the Democratic chairmen of three key House committees said while there are clear differences between House and Senate bills, both will bring fundamental health care coverage to millions who are currently uninsured. 
 Obama administration officials have been quoted as saying they anticipate negotiations on a final bill would not be complete until after the President's State of the Union Address in January, and could slip even later into the new year. 
 President Obama issued a statement to the press in the State Dining Room in the White House saying that the vote is ""legislation that brings us toward the end of a nearly century-long struggle to reform America's health care system.""
 He also pointed out the bill's strengths, noting, ""The reform bill that passed the Senate this morning, like the House bill, includes the toughest measures ever taken to hold the insurance industry accountable.  Insurance companies will no longer be able to deny you coverage on the basis of a preexisting condition.  They will no longer be able to drop your coverage when you get sick.  No longer will you have to pay unlimited amounts out of your own pocket for the treatments you need.  And you'll be able to appeal unfair decisions by insurance companies to an independent party.""
 He also noted how historic the bill is, saying, ""If passed, this will be the most important piece of social policy since the Social Security Act in the 1930s, and the most important reform of our health care system since Medicare passed in the 1960s.""
 Obama noted the potential social impact, saying, ""It's the impact reform will have on Americans who no longer have to go without a checkup or prescriptions that they need because they can’t afford them; on families who no longer have to worry that a single illness will send them into financial ruin; and on businesses that will no longer face exorbitant insurance rates that hamper their competitiveness.""
 Obama afterwards made phone calls to various Senators and other people, including Victoria Kennedy and David Turner of Little Rock, Arkansas. Mr. Turner had his health insurance rescinded in January of last year, after his insurance company went back into his record and alleged that he failed to disclose his full medical record at the time he applied for coverage. Turner was First Lady Michelle Obama's guest during her husband's speech to a joint session of Congress on health care reform back in September.

"," On Wednesday the U.S. Senate released its version of the U.S. healthcare overhaul that has recently been advocated by President Barack Obama.
 The U.S. Senate Finance Committee released an 18-page summary of the 223-page bill that will, according to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Senator Baucus, cost US$856 billion over 10 years.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the bill will cost US$774 billion over 10 years and will cover 94% of Americans.  The Senate version was orchestrated by Senator Baucus, a Democrat from Montana.  The bill was released without any Republican support from the committee.  However, today, the bill received support from a bi-partisan group of Senators including the Republican Senator from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Independent Joe Liberman.  If the bill's passage is determined along party lines, Democrats will need at least one Republican Senator to avoid a possible filibuster in the Senate.
 The proposal mandates nation-wide individual insurance by 2013 and omits a government-run insurance clause as is included in the U.S. House version; instead, the plan calls for non-profit healthcare cooperatives.  The healthcare cooperatives would be provided with US$6 billion in initial funding to cover start-up fees and costs. Individuals refusing to obtain coverage can be charged up to US$950 annually with families fined up to US$3,800 per year.  Small businesses will not be mandated to provide healthcare to their employees but those who do will receive tax credits. Also, insurances companies that have more expensive individual plans will be taxed for 35% of the amount that that the plan exceeds the federal individual threshold of US$8,000 or the family threshold of US$21,000. The bill includes clauses for protection against coverage suspensions due to illnesses and protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions. It will not pre-empt state laws on abortion and does not provide for abortion payments except in cases of rape or incest. The plan also mandates registration with the Social Security Administration as a means to avoid illegal alien use of the program.
 The bill will reportedly be paid for by US$850 billion in spending reduction, taxes and fees to include reduction in Medicare benefits.  The Senate Finance Committee is the last approval authority before the Senate or House bills can be considered for floor debate.

"," Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) [1], a U.S. legislative watchdog group, has released a report attempting to document the unethical and illegal activities of who they are calling the ""most tainted members of Congress"". In describing the reasons for the report Melanie Sloan, executive director of CREW said, ""[CREW] was compelled to research and release a report on these corrupt members because the ethics committees in both the House and Senate are completely inert. The report calls for the House and Senate to act to investigate and take appropriate action against them for these violations of the rules."" She went on to attack both parties regarding ethics, ""Democrats are just as much to blame as Republicans for the current ethics deadlock. The Democrats won't file ethics complaints against even the most egregious violators like DeLay and Ney…. The Democrats are spineless."" 
 The report covers possible violations of federal laws, as well as congressional ethics rules.  To compile the report, CREW drew upon Federal Election Commission (FEC) reports and audits, sworn testimony, emails, and personal financial and travel disclosure forms. By analyzing that information, CREW then attempted to determine if the member's activities violated federal laws, regulations, or congressional ethics rules.  The 13 members of Congress covered are:
 The report is entitled ""Beyond DeLay: The 13 Most Corrupt Members of Congress"", seeking to capitalize on the current media attention on ethics that has come about due to the indictments of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay.  However, the report does not cover any of Tom Delay's ethics problems, nor does it have any information on his current legal problems.
 The report was criticized by the office of Rick Renzi, one of the congressmen listed, arguing that CREW are biased and pursuing a political agenda. ""This group is run by one of the biggest Democratic Party donors in the nation and is a mouthpiece for its fierce political attacks,"" said Renzi's office in a statement. ""The group's biased accusations show the campaign season is starting early.""
 Representative Burns, also one of the representatives named in the report, responded through spokesman James Pendleton calling CREW's report ""pure politics."" The press secretary for Representative Bob Ney, also named in the CREW report, said, ""We don't give Melanie Sloan and her liberal organization an ounce of credibility.""  
 Both Members of the House whose residences have been searched as part of a criminal investigation, Cunningham and Jefferson, are included on the list.  Burns, Ney, and Feeney are cited for their dealings with lobbyist Jack Abramoff.  11 out of the 13 named representatives are Republicans.

"," In response to recent accusations that United States government employees have engaged in Wikipedia vandalism and other forms of perceived negative editing of articles, Wikipedia editors have set up a webpage listing all Wikipedia edits made through IP addresses that are allocated to the United States House of Representatives and other United States government agencies. The House IP address was briefly banned from editing Wikipedia articles in the wake of the initial controversy, but the ban was lifted on January 30 after Wikipedia administrators decided that there have been a number of valuable contributions made through the House and Senate IP addresses in addition to the controversial edits.
 On January 31 and February 1, however, the U.S. House of Representatives' common IP address, 143.231.249.141, were banned again for three hours due to vandalism. Because the IP address is shared by House staff members, it is uncertain whether or not the same person(s) responsible for the previous vandalism are also responsible for the latest.
 Examples of contributions submitted through the House IP address included removing, ""In 2005, he has come under scrutiny for accepting campaign contributions from embattled former house leader Tom Delay,"" from the article on Thad McCotter, removing election statistics from the article on Dan Lungren, and, in the article on Marilyn Musgrave, changing the paragraph 
 to
 After the block from Wikipedia expired, the House of Representatives user continued to edit the article on Chris Shays. Chris Shays had co-sponsored a bill with Marty Meehan, whose staffers had previously been found to have been negatively editing Wikipedia entries, The American Civil Liberties Union said of the bill ""key elements of Shays-Meehan violate the First Amendment right to free speech because the legislation contains provisions that would violate the constitutionally-protected right of the people to express their opinions about issues through broadcast advertising if they mention the name of a candidate."" All mentions of the bill were removed from the article. Also removed was a paragraph about Chris Shays raising $70,000 with House Speaker Dennis Hastert at a country club event.
 Again, the IP address was blocked for an eight-hour period.
 Wikipedia edits in Congress are not coming from the House of Representatives alone. An edit from the Senate in July removed references to a plagiarism scandal with Senator Joe Biden, who has informally said he may seek a Democratic nomination for president in 2008. As of February 4, 2006, the edit has not fixed by Wikipedia users.
 IP addresses from the CIA, the Department of Justice, the Marines, and the Navy are listed on the site as having made several cases of vandalism. Some examples of vandalism from the Department of Justice IP ranges involve articles on TV and radio shows, a baseball player, or just complaining about their work. In addition to accusations of vandalism, there have also been accusations of government employees introducing perceived bias, political spinning, or misinformation into Wikipedia articles by adding or removing information.
 These cases include articles on an Irish politician, and in the George W. Bush article, introducing accusations of Hugo Chavez being a dictator, and removing information covering the George W. Bush substance abuse controversy. In addition, a person using a Department of Justice IP address edited a page covering indicted former Republican Majority Leader Tom DeLay. The editor removed two paragraphs stating a judge ruled that Tom DeLay had broken state law by not disclosing over $600,000 of fundraising money, a quote from Tom DeLay in which he stated that it drives the Democrats crazy wondering why the Republican Party institutes pro-Israeli policy, and a subsection on controversies involving DeLay's relatives. Edits to George W. Bush's article were done within the span of an hour. Edits to Tom DeLay's article were made within an hour as well, although followed by a shorter, minor second session of editing later that day.
 An editor using a CIA IP address is accused of vandalizing an article on the current president of Iran. Editors using Marine and Navy IP addresses based in Pensacola, Florida are accused of vandalizing an article on a rock song and on former U.S. president Bill Clinton, and accused of adding racist comments to articles on an actor and Martin Luther King, Jr., and adding comments that are perceived to criticize the men and women in the Navy reserves.
 The IP addresses of the Department of Justice, the CIA, and the Navy and Marines stationed in Pensacola, Florida were found using the American Registry for Internet Numbers at the official website. Neither the government nor the Wikimedia Foundation have released an official statement.
 The U.S. House of Representatives' IP address is not the first governmental address to have been blocked after accusations of disrupting Wikipedia. The IP address belonging to a subdivision of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development in Alberta, Canada was blocked for three months since late 2005. An IP address belonging to the German Bundestag has been repeatedly blocked from the German Wikipedia after accusations of vandalism, including sexually explicit comments.

"," Charles Nesbitt Wilson, a former United States naval officer and twelve-term Democratic Representative from the 2nd congressional district in Texas, died on Wednesday in Lufkin, Texas.  He was 76 with a history of heart ailments, receiving a transplant in 2007.
 Memorial Medical Center, Lufkin said the preliminary cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest. Jack Gorden Jr., the mayor of Lufkin, confirmed the death.
 He was best known for initiating Operation Cyclone, the largest CIA covert operation, which supplied military equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, and paramilitary officers to the Afghan Mujahideen during the Soviet war in Afghanistan. His campaign was the subject of the non-fiction book Charlie Wilson's War and the film  'Charlie Wilson's War'.
 U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said Wilson's ""efforts and exploits helped repel an invader, liberate a people, and bring the Cold War to a close. [...] After the Soviets left, Charlie kept fighting for the Afghan people and warned against abandoning that traumatized country to its fate — a warning we should have heeded then, and should remember today"".
 Born in Trinity, Texas, Wilson graduated from Trinity High School in 1951. While a student at Sam Houston State University, he was appointed to the United States Naval Academy. Between 1956 and 1960, Wilson served in the Navy, attaining the rank of lieutenant. After four years as a surface fleet officer, he was assigned to the Pentagon as part of an intelligence unit that evaluated the Soviet Union's nuclear capabilities.

"," Current United States Speaker of the House and 2012 Republican vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan announced Wednesday he will not seek reelection and plans to retire from the U.S. House of Representatives when his term expires in January.
 ""We all know that I did not seek this job, I took it reluctantly, but I have given this job everything I have and I have no regret whatsoever in accepting this responsibility,"" Ryan told the press. Ryan took over the Speaker position after John Boehner retired in 2015.  Ryan cited wanting to spend more time with his three children.  Some reports suggested he was also disillusioned with the Trump presidency.  Ryan contradicted this in public: ""I'm grateful to the president for giving us this opportunity to do big things to get this country on the right track,"" he said. According to Axios, Ryan considered last December's restructuring of the U.S. tax code to be the most important accomplishment during his time as Speaker.
 President Trump said via Twitter, ""Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!""
 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Ryan as ""a good man who is always true to his word"" and said ""[w]ith his newfound political freedom, I hope the Speaker uses his remaining time in Congress to break free from the hard-right factions of his caucus that have kept Congress from getting real things done.""
 Not all reactions to Ryan's departure were admiring.  While various Democrats and others have opposed Ryan for his Republican views, many Republicans have criticized what they describe as a lack of support for President Trump's projects, such as the US Mexico border wall Trump has proposed to build on the U.S. border with Mexico.  Far-right media outlet Breitbart News described Ryan on Tuesday as ""the leader of the globalist wing of the Republican Party,"" citing his ""pro-immigration, wage-crushing, big business-first record, whereby American workers have been left behind by multinational free trade and mass immigration."" Fox News commentator Sebastian Gorka tweeted ""GOOD RIDDANCE."" Amongst late-night comedians, Stephen Colbert of The Late Show called him ""CrossFit Dracula"" in a reference to his well-documented fondness for fitness programs: ""He said today he wants to spend more time with his wife and kids. Which, of course, is what he calls his biceps."" Jimmy Fallon of The Tonight Show added ""House Speaker Paul Ryan announced that he is retiring from Congress. He said he wants to spend more time with his children at home, and less time with the child in the White House.""
 Paul Ryan currently represents a district in southeastern Wisconsin. As of January, he will have served twenty years in the United States Congress.
 According to Business Insider, waiting until January of next year would push Ryan into a slightly higher pension bracket within the Federal Employees Retirement System because his time as Speaker will give him three years at a sustained salary of US$223,500.  If he retires as planned, he would be eligible to draw noticeably more annually than if he retired sooner.
 House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, asked by Fox News whether he would run for Ryan's position as Speaker, responded with a reference to the upcoming 2018 midterm elections, ""We're getting way ahead of ourselves. [...] We've got to make sure we keep the majority."" 
 In November, one third of the U.S. Senate and the entire House of Representatives are up for re-election.  The Republicans currently have a majority in both houses of congress, but would lose control of the House if the Democrats gained 23 out of its 435 seats.  Close to 30 Republicans have announced they would be retiring this year. BBC analyst Anthony Zurcher speculates Ryan may be retiring now to preserve his reputation for a presidential run sometime in the future.
 In the U.S. government, the Speaker of the House automatically assumes the presidency if the president and vice president are both killed or incapacitated.  The Speaker is elected by the members of the House of Representatives, and so is usually a member of whichever of the two main political parities happens to have the majority that session.

"," The Indo-US civil nuclear cooperation agreement, which gained waiver from the 45-member Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) in Vienna on September 6, 2008, will be ratified by the US Congress to remove 34 years of sanctions against India, following a nuclear device testing in 1974. 
 NSG's India specific waiver allows India to join a select club of nations free to have nuclear weapons, without the international watchdog International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) breathing down its neck. The waiver comes after strong opposition from China, New Zealand and Austria amongst a few others. However consensus for the waiver prevailed after India reiterated its commitment to non-proliferation and voluntary unilateral moratorium on further nuclear tests. 
 With a USD 100 billion nuclear trade possible over the next 10 years, a number of countries including France, Russia and Canada are all vying for a piece of action. Meanwhile India has agreed to the  US request to hold back discussions with others till US Congressional ratification so as not to prejudice the US firms. 
 Latest reports indicate that US administration is  working overtime to ensure a smooth passage for the deal in Congress session that began on Monday and trying to persuade the lawmakers not to insist on the mandatory 30 day rest period required to present the agreement for approval. It is also confirmed that U.S. President George W. Bush will welcome Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on September 25, 2008 for joint signing of the agreement.

"," The United States Ambassador to India, David Mulford, has reportedly hinted that the U.S. civil nuclear energy pact with India may face problems getting approved by Congress if India refused to vote against Iran at the upcoming meeting of the United Nations nuclear watchdog committee.
 The nuclear pact was made after a July 2005 policy shift by U.S. President George W. Bush that offered cooperation in India's development of civilian atomic power industry in exchange for its support of the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) nonproliferation standards.
 The U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack stated at a Wednesday briefing that, ""The ambassador was expressing his personal opinion about what the potential political outcome might be. He was giving his personal assessment of how the Congress might react to such an action by India."" McCormack added that, ""We certainly would encourage and hope that they (India) vote for referral this time around.""
 The IAEA is scheduled to meet February 2 to discuss Iran's referral to the U.N. Security Council over its resumption of uranium enrichment. The U.S. claims that Iran's nuclear program is aimed at developing weapons, a claim that Tehran denies.
 India's foreign ministry rejected any attempt to tie its stance on Iran to the deal with the U.S. on acquiring nuclear know-how.
 India has previously supported the IAEA's declaration in September of 2005 that Iran had failed to comply with its international obligations. 
 The U.S. also opposes the negotiations, begun in 1994, on a proposed gas pipeline between India and Iran which is intended to provide India with increased energy capacities.

"," A US$14 billion bailout package deal for the ""Big Three"" United States automakers — Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors — has been rejected in the United States Senate after failing a procedural vote.
 The bill was rejected after bipartisan discussions on the bailout broke down when Republican Party leaders insisted that the United Auto Workers (UAW) union agree to increase wage cuts by next year in order to bring their pay into line with those of Japanese automobile companies in the United States. The UAW refused to meet the demands.
 The final vote count in the Senate was 52-35, eight short of the 60 needed to pass. Only ten Republicans joined forty Democrats and two independents in voting for the bill. Three Democrats voted with thirty-one Republicans against it.
 Senate Majority leader Harry Reid said that he was ""terribly disappointed"" by the failure of the bill to pass. ""I dread looking at Wall Street tomorrow. It's not going to be a pleasant sight,"" Reid said. ""Millions of Americans, not only the auto workers but people who sell cars, car dealerships, people who work on cars are going to be directly impacted and affected."" 
 Republican Senator Bob Corker was also unhappy about the rejection. ""We were about three words away from a deal. We solved everything substantively and about three words keep us from reaching a conclusion,"" he said.

"," The United States Congress has returned from a two-week recess to face a busy agenda before it completes its session later this month. President George W. Bush is urging lawmakers to approve his funding request for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a first priority.
 President Bush renewed his criticism of majority Democrats in Congress who want to tie a timetable for the withdrawal of United States troops from Iraq with approval of more funds for the war effort.
 ""It's unconscionable to deny funds to our troops in harm's way because some in Congress want to force a self-defeating policy — especially when we're seeing the benefits of success,"" said President Bush.
 Mr. Bush says progress made on the battlefield as a result of a boost in the number of troops in Iraq this year would be undermined by a troop withdrawal timeline.
 The President has requested US$196 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The House of Representatives has approved US$50 billion of that. But in the Senate, Republican blocked a similar funding package last month because it included a timetable for a troop withdrawal.
 Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, said the failure of the Senate to approve the war funding should not be blamed on the Democrats.
 ""If not for the stubborn refusal of the president and his Republicans enablers to work with us, we would have accomplished a lot more,"" said Senator Reid.
 Although Mr. Bush had warned that the Pentagon would be forced to begin laying off civilian employees if the funds are not received soon, Senator Reid said the Pentagon could shift funds for the war effort from other accounts.
 Besides funding for the war, Congress must also pass legislation funding government agencies and programs. In addition, lawmakers may also try to revise a wiretapping law that expires in two months.

"," The United States Congress is currently drafting a bill known as the Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Efficiency Act of 2006 that would revise and update the 1996 Telecommunications Act. Currently phone and cable lobbyists who own the broadband networks, such as those from AT&T and BellSouth, are calling on the federal government to permit them to operate Internet and other digital communications services as private networks.  The bill as it now stands states that certain classes of Internet providers ""may not unreasonably"" impair, interfere, restrict or limit applications or services, such as Web sites or voice-over-IP phone connections. 
 Consumer advocates such as Common Cause and some large Internet companies such as Google and Yahoo are concerned that this change will result in a loss of what is being called network neutrality, and are demanding specific language in the bill to address it. Three weeks ago, the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications rejected an amendment to the bill that would have strengthened provisions for network neutrality. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 28 to 8.
 Network neutrality is a principle of computer networking that describes networks designed so that no communication, application, or service is either given preferential treatment or restricted.  
 Advocates of network neutrality fear that allowing broadband networks to operate unregulated could lead to preferential treatment toward certain companies at the expense of others.  Phone companies who oppose network neutrality legislation contend that some mechanism needs to be in place in order to pay for expansion of the public Internet.  
 Edward Whitacre, AT&T's chief executive officer, had made remarks on the issue that consumer groups found inflammatory.  In remarks made on November 7, 2005, presumably referring to Internet sites using their network connections, he called for ""some mechanism for these people who use these pipes to pay for the portion they're using. Why should they be allowed to use my pipes?""  
 Whitacre has since reversed his public statements, saying on March 21, 2006, ""Any provider that blocks access to content is inviting customers to find another provider. And that's just bad business.""
 Federal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin believes that the FCC already has the authority to enforce network neutrality provisions, citing a North Carolina case in which the FCC acted against Madison River Communications for blocking Vonage VoIP phone service.
 Representative Fred Upton from Michigan, chairman of the Telecommunications and the Internet Subcommittee, describes the bill as a way to ""ignite the marketplace — unleashing great advances in technology and delivering to consumers a variety of new services at a lower cost that were once never even imagined. Every consumer in the nation with a telephone, television and access to the Internet will be better for it — the wave of the future is now."" 
 Michael Copps, a FCC Commissioner, said recently, ""This Internet may not be the one we know in the future there are threats to it out there... Entrenched interests are already jockeying to constrain the openness that has been the Internet's defining hallmark."" 
 A recent poll done by The Consumer Federation of America (See source 5) shows that the Internet has taken on an important role in the daily life of Americans. With two-thirds reporting it is important for personal communications and researching products, over half said it is important for getting news and, about 40 percent cited online banking, e-commerce, and retrieving government information as significant ways in which they used the internet. They expressed a great deal of concern about discriminatory practices of communications network operators.
 The revision of the 1996 Telecommunications Act was proposed by House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Joe Barton, R-Texas, and U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, D-Ill., in late March and went on to the full committee on April 5.

"," A House subcommittee voted Thursday to sharply reduce the federal government's financial spending for Fiscal Year '06, including eliminating taxpayer funds that help produce such shows as Sesame Street and Arthur.
 The spending cutbacks far exceeded even those requested by the White House.  Among initiatives slated for reduction are $39 million for conversion to digital programming and $50 million for upgrading PBS's aging satellite technology.
 The subcommittee also acted to eliminate federal money for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a body created by Congress to pass funds on to public broadcasters.  The CPB would see a 25 percent reduction in next year's budget, down from $400 million to $300 million, funds that currently account for 14.9% of all public broadcasting revenues[1].
 Ideological concerns over publicly-financed content have recently become a point of contention for the Republican-controlled CPB.  The day after the new budget was approved, CNN obtained an internal memo by NPR's executive vice president Ken Stern that blamed the cuts on ""recent public turbulence caused by CPB chairman Ken Tomlinson's irresponsible attacks on public broadcasting.""  Stern's memo also told staffers the cut would not hurt NPR directly because it receives little direct support from the CPB. Instead, he emphasized, smaller local stations that rely upon federal dollars are most likely to be affected, which could in turn take a bite out of regular dues and fees, NPR's largest revenue source.
 Under the budget, the Ready to Learn program's $23 million appropriation for children's shows is rescinded in its entirety. John Lawson, president of the Association of Public Television Stations, said the cut was retribution for an episode of ""Postcards From Buster"" featuring a pair of lesbian parents from Vermont. A spokesman for the Appropriations Committee, John Scofield, denied the claim.
 ""Ready to Learn was one of more than 50 programs terminated in the spending bill,"" he told the New York Times. ""It might be a nice program to do, but not in a flat budget with large budget deficits. We felt the same way about 49 other programs.""
 Overall, the cuts would signal the most dramatic cutback of public broadcasting since Congress created the CPB in 1967.  The spending bill is expected to pass the Appropriations Committee and the House, but final legislation will be negotiated with the Senate.

 Material goods such as jewelry, watches, expensive furs, jet planes, boats, yachts, and luxury cars had already been subjected to additional taxes back in 1990. After 3 years these taxes were repealed, though the luxury automobiles tax was still active for the next 13 years.

It also stated that although its ravaging effect on employment in several industries was sensible, ""the turnover that occurred in Congress made it possible for the new group to learn the same lessons again"".
 The luxury tax could produce unpredictable effects for the watch industry and the report was meant to inform the members of this branch about the effects of these taxes on this luxury goods' industry.

"," The United States Congress passed a US$787 billion stimulus package late Friday night, in an effort to curb the recession and boost the faltering US economy.
 The bill was passed by a vote of 60&ndashp;38, barely reaching the minimum number of 60 votes needed to make the bill a law. Only three Republican senators voted for the measure. Shortly before the Senate vote, the US House of Representatives approved of the stimulus by a margin of 246–183, with all 176 Republicans and seven Democrats voting against the bill.
 The Senate vote was delayed until night so that Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown could fly back from Ohio, where his mother had recently died. He cast the final and decisive sixtieth vote in favor of the stimulus bill.
 President Barack Obama is expected to sign the bill into law in Denver, Colorado on Tuesday, February 17.
 ""This is a major milestone on our road to recovery, and I want to thank the members of Congress who came together in common purpose to make it happen,"" Obama said in his weekly address. ""I will sign this legislation into law shortly, and we'll begin making the immediate investments necessary to put people back to work doing the work America needs done. This historic step won't be the end of what we do to turn our economy around, but the beginning.""
 64% of the stimulus package is intended for spending and money for social programmes, while another 34% is devoted to tax cuts. The plan also limits cash bonuses and incentive compensations for Wall Street executives. Over $48 billion of the stimulus has been reserved for transportation projects, such as high-speed rail, road, and bridge construction. Tens of billions more will be used for funding states to prevent any cuts that they would otherwise be forced to make to aid local governments and schools.
 Democrats say that the plan will help create three and a half million jobs, and that the plan's tax cuts will help 95% of all US residents, mainly with the use of $800 breaks for couples and $400 for individuals. Those who do not earn enough money to pay income taxes will also be eligible for the breaks. Additionally, breaks will be given to first-time homebuyers and car buyers, in an effort to give a boost to two industries badly affected by the recession.
 Senate Majority leader Harry Reid said that the stimulus package was the most important legislation that he had ever worked on. ""The country is in trouble and we're so fortunate we were able to get it passed. It's going to give this country a shot in the arm.""
 Others, however, such as Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell, are highly critical of the plan. ""This isn't Monopoly money. It's real. It adds up, and it has to be paid back, by our children and by their children,"" he said, adding that it ""is unlikely to have much stimulative effect.""
 ""The bill that was about jobs, jobs, jobs has turned into a bill that's about spending, spending, spending,"" said House Republican leader John Boehner from Ohio, throwing a copy of the bill on the floor in protest.
 Last week, the House of Representatives passed a stimulus package worth $825 billion with no support from Republicans. Shortly thereafter, the Senate passed a slightly different version of the bill worth $838 billion. The differences between the two bills had to be bridged in a Senate-House committee before it was voted upon in both houses.

 The White House is sending Congress a report to answer questions presented in a House resolution passed on June 3, which set a two-week deadline. The deadline to respond was this Friday, and Boehner claims that the failure to do so would also have been a violation of the War Powers Resolution. 
 It is common for the president and the legislature to argue over war powers. The US Constitution establishes the president as the commander-in-chief of the military, but it also gives Congress the power to declare war. The White House believes that it is complying with the War Powers Resolution by frequently briefing Congress on the Libya mission, having testified at ten congressional hearings and participated in more than 30 staff briefings. Boehner argues, however, that the administration should have sought explicit congressional approval for the action. 
 The lawsuit, filed by Dennis Kucinich (Democratic representative from Ohio) and Walter B. Jones (Republican representative from North Carolina), along with eight other congressmen, will cite the legislature's ""power of the purse"" in addition to the War Powers Resolution. It will ""challenge the executive branch's circumvention of Congress,"" and its use of UN and NATO mandates rather than Congress to justify its own actions, according to Kucinich.

"," US congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords was shot at a public event in Tucson, Arizona today. At least five were killed and several others were wounded in the shooting, including at least one of Giffords' staff. The shooting occurred at a Safeway supermarket where Giffords, a Democratic Party member who represented Arizona's 8th congressional district, had scheduled a public ""Congress on Your Corner"" event.
 Giffords was widely reported as having died after the attack, but her public relations personnel later said she was undergoing surgery.  Giffords was shot in the head at close range, and according to the Pima County sheriff, Giffords, aged 40, died from the attack. National Public Radio, however, reported that there were conflicting reports about her death. 
 Giffords was airlifted to a nearby hospital and underwent emergency surgery. A spokesperson for University Medical Center said, ""She is currently in surgery. She's alive,"" adding that nine other shooting victims had been taken to the hospital. After the surgery, the hospital announced Giffords was alive with a single gunshot wound to the head and that she was responsive.
 The hospital also said that a nine-year-old was among those killed in the shooting. David Gonzales, a US Marshal, said that federal judge John Roll also died from his wounds. President Barack Obama said the shooter killed a total of five people.
 Peter Michaels, of Arizona Public Media, said Giffords had been speaking to several people when someone began firing randomly from around 4 feet (1.2 metres) away. The gunman attempted to flee but was tackled by an onlooker and taken into police custody. Described as in his late teens to early twenties, he was later identified as 22-year-old Jared Loughner, who used a handgun in the attack.

"," The United States House of Representatives today passed an amendment that would allow Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the Flag of the United States. The bill (H.J.Res.10), whose main sponsor was Randy ""Duke"" Cunningham (R-Calif.), was passed by a vote of 286 to 130. The required two-thirds was present. This is the fifth time a flag burning amendment has passed the House. 
 The bill will now move on to the Senate, where it stands the best chance of passing ever. If a majority of two-thirds passes the bill, it will then move on to the states to be ratified with a seven-year window open on the ratification. Each time an amendment like this was passed in the House, it died in the Senate, the last time being in 2000.
 An informal survey conducted by the Associated Press suggested that the vote will be close — 34 senators surveyed opposed the amendment, the exact number required to defeat it. However, supporters of the amendment are optimistic that the amendment will pass because four seats were gained by the Republicans in the election last November.
 The amendment seeks to bypass the 1989 Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson which ruled that desecration of the flag was legal; flag burning was established to be a form of protected speech under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  In New Zealand, a 22-year-old law banning the destruction of their flag was also recently overturned as it was considered an act of free speech.

"," Both the United States House of Representatives and Senate agreed to a bill yesterday to end the government shutdown and to raise the debt limit of the federal government. President Barack Obama has signed the bill into law.
 Workers employed by agencies of the US federal government who had previously been furloughed have returned to work. The law has funded the government until January 15 and has extended the debt ceiling until February 7. The law also establishes a bipartisan committee to look into drafting a long-term budget agreement. This committee is due to report back to Congress in December.
 Republicans did not manage to extract any significant changes to Obama's healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. They had hoped to get the implementation of the law delayed by a year, but have instead provided that those wishing to sign up for healthcare benefits must provide proof of their income.
 In a statement, the House Speaker, John Boehner, said the Republicans would continue to fight Obama's healthcare law: ""Our drive to stop the train wreck that is the president's health care law will continue. We will rely on aggressive oversight that highlights the law's massive flaws and smart, targeted strikes that split the legislative coalition the president has relied upon to force his health care law on the American people.""

 ""Behind me through the window you can see the Washington Monument. [...] Tomorrow, I'm pleased to announce the Washington Monument as well as the entire federal government will be open for business,"" said US President Barack Obama of the deal, which was reached only after several days of discussion. Earlier on Friday, US legislators deflected claims that a midnight deal was being worked out, but Republican Party sources later reported that a deal was likely to be reached.
 Speaker of the House John Boehner (Republican-Ohio) announced late Friday night that he was glad that both political parties were able to ""come to an agreement that will in fact cut spending and keep [the US] government open."" The deal was apparently reached after disputes over government funding for organizations such as Planned Parenthood were resolved. Boehner said both sides decided on a six-day extension, or ""bridge,"" of government funding, which would allow Congress to work out a final solution to last the remainder of the 2011 fiscal year, which ends in September. Voting for the resulting agreement will take place some time next week, according to Boehner.
 The last complete US government shutdown occurred in 1995, during the administration of Bill Clinton, lasting five days; it was proceeded by a 21-day partial shutdown. In the event of a government shutdown, essential federal employees are still required to work, but nonessential personnel are placed on unpaid furloughs. Essential staff include military personnel, air traffic controllers, emergency officials, and intelligence officials.

"," The US Senate, by a vote of 60 to 39, has decided to begin debate on legislation crafted by majority Democrats to reform the country's health care system.
 The measure, opposed by Republican senators, was voted on Saturday evening.  One Republican Senator, George Voinovich of Ohio, was not present and did not vote.
 It was not clear until earlier in the day whether the Democrats would have enough votes to bring the bill to the Senate floor for full debate.
 During the day, two moderate Democrats announced they would support the move during a rare Saturday session. That gave the Democrats the 60 votes they needed to move the measure forward. The legislation is intended to extend health care coverage to millions of uninsured people, prevent insurance companies from denying benefits, and limit the growth of spending on medical care.
 In the rare session, opposition Republicans criticized the bill, saying it would drive up the cost of insurance and add to the nation's deficit.
 While Democrats won the vote to begin debate, passage of the bill is not certain. Some moderate Democrats have signaled strong opposition to components of the bill, including a government-run option to compete with private insurers. However, the Senate version does allow states to opt out of the public option.
 Senator Blanche Lincoln, who was one of the Democrats who had wavered on whether to support the bill, decided to vote for it. ""Although I don't agree with everything in this bill, I have concluded that I believe that it is more important that we begin this debate to improve our nation's healthcare system for all Americans, [...]"" she said. Two other Democratic senators said they were uncertain about the bill, and did not make up their minds until hours before the vote, adding to the uncertainty.
 The Congressional Budget Office said the Senate bill, unveiled on Wednesday, would cost $849 billion over the next decade. Analysts say the plan also would reduce U.S. deficits by nearly $130 billion in the same period. If the bill passes, it would have to be merged with one passed earlier this month by the House of Representatives.  The House narrowly approved its bill on a sharply divided vote of 220 to 215.
 President Barack Obama has asked Congress to deliver legislation to him for signing by the end of the year.

"," The United States House of Representatives voted to hold two current Cabinet officers, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Attorney General William Barr, in contempt of Congress, citing their refusal to disclose to Congress documents related to President Donald Trump's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. The vote passed primarily along party lines, 230-to-198. Historically, the Department of Justice has not pursued criminal charges against those held in contempt of Congress.
 In April, the House Oversight and Reform Committee authorized subpoenas for documents relating to the administration's decision to try to add a question about citizenship to the census, attempting to discern the true reason for the addition of the citizenship question. Barr and Ross, however, refused to hand over the documents. On June 12, minutes before the Oversight Committee voted to refer them to the full House to be held in contempt, Trump formally claimed the documents were subject to executive privilege.
 For weeks, the Trump administration has been trying to add the question, ""Is this person a citizen of the United States?"", to the upcoming 2020 census, with the stated rationale of improving enforcement of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. In late June, the United States Supreme Court ruled against its initial attempt, saying the justification presented for the question was ""contrived."" A few days later, on July 2, Trump announced he would drop his bid to add the question, before reversing course the next day and pressing forward. A few days later the administration said he would use an executive order to add the citizenship question to the census, disregarding the Supreme Court's ruling. The administration finally gave up on July 11, arranging instead to provide citizenship information to the Census Bureau from other government agencies.
 Only once before has Congress voted to hold a Cabinet officer in contempt while they were in office: Attorney General Eric Holder was held in contempt in 2012 for refusing to turn over documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. People held in contempt of Congress are referred to the Department of Justice for potential criminal prosecution. As Attorney General, Barr leads the Department of Justice. Kerri Kupec, spokeswoman for the Trump administration's Department of Justice, sharply criticized the House's decision, which Ross has referred to as ""gamesmanship"" and a ""stunt"".
 The citizenship question was last included in the general census in 1950.

"," On Wednesday, the United States House of Representatives impeached President Donald Trump over complaints arising from an alleged abuse of power. Trump, the third President to be impeached by the House, is to face trial in the Senate.
 The House passed two different articles of impeachment. The first charged Trump with abuse of power, and the second accused him of obstruction of Congress. The abuse of power charge stemmed from allegations Trump tried to pressure the Ukrainian government to launch an investigation of Joe Biden's son, in order to help Trump's chances in the 2020 United States presidential election in which Biden is also running. The articles passed by votes of 230-to-197 and 229-to-198 respectively.
 The impeachment occurred largely along partisan lines, with Democratic members of the House voting in favor of the impeachment, and Republican members opposing. Two Democratic Representatives, Collin Peterson and Jeff Van Drew, opposed both articles of impeachment, and a third, Jared Golden, voted for the first article but against the second. In the immediate aftermath of the vote, CNN reported Jeff Van Drew was expected to leave the Democratic party.
 Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate Majority Leader, reportedly previously committed to proceeding with an impeachment trial, anticipated to begin in January. He publicly stated the trial would not be impartial, saying he anticipated having ""a largely partisan outcome"" in the Senate. Republicans hold a majority in the Senate, and for a trial to result in removal from office a two-thirds majority is needed. If Trump were removed, the Senate constitutionally could disqualify him from serving as President again.
 The House has only impeached two other Presidents. Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998, and Andrew Johnson in 1868. The Senate acquitted both of them.

Democrat Dennis Kucinich, on the other hand, opposed the bill for not going far enough, calling it an ""illusion"" that ""locks us into a framework that will fail.""

 The resolution, in the 109-page compromise bill, based on high marginal support of the House-Senate conferees, will be sent directly to the  US Senate which is also expected to also pass it unanimously by a voice vote today, before the Congress goes into Christmas recess.
 The deal offers India US nuclear technology in exchange for inspectors' access to Indian civilian reactors. The accord is hailed as historic by many of the representatives, but critics said that it will damage non-proliferation efforts.
 Democratic congressman Tom Lantos said, ""India is a state that should be at the very centre of our foreign policy and our attention."" He added that a partnership with India would help in regulation of the peaceful and responsible spread of nuclear power.
 Represenative from Illinois Henry John Hyde, who is the co-writer of the bill, argued that the conference report, titled ""Henty J Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006"", is a judicious balance of competing all priorities and accommodates the concerns of administration. He added that President George Bush is expected to sign it into law in a White House ceremony on Monday, if the bill passed by Senate.
 Representative from New York Joseph Crowley, who was instrumental in pushing the bill, said, ""With the final version of this legislation approved for this historic agreement between India and the United States to move forward, the Congress has provided realistic parameters for the benefit of both our nations. Now the ball falls into the President's and the Indian government's court to move forward, and ensure a positive relation between India and the United States well into this century.""
 Representative from California Barbara Lee, who is from the Democratic Party, opposed the bill and said that it would lead to problems by way of doing lasting damage to more than 30-years of non-proliferation policies.
 The law will allow the nuclear cooperation between India and United States after more than 30 years. After the bill is passed, the Indian government will have to conclude a bilateral agreement with the US government and engage with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

George Bush attempted to respond to the criticisms of the bill by US citizens. ""I know many Americans are worried about the cost of the bill, and I understand their concern.

"," U.S. Congressional Democrats are asking the Justice Department to investigate whether the CIA's destruction of videotapes documenting the interrogation of terrorism suspects amounts to obstruction of justice. 
 The acknowledgement by Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden that his agency destroyed the interrogation videotapes in 2005 sparked a firestorm of criticism among Congressional Democrats. They suggested the tapes could have provided key evidence in ongoing trials brought by terrorism suspects who are alleging they were tortured.
 Senator Ted Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, said, ""What would cause the CIA to take this action? The answer is obvious - cover up. The agency was desperate to cover up damning evidence of their practices.""
 Human Rights Watch's Senior Counterterrorism Counsel commented to Google news saying, ""The CIA was well aware that its interrogations crossed a line considered by many to be torture. Now some in the CIA may also be guilty of obstruction of justice as well - a serious felony that carries a possible 20 year sentence. There needs to be a serious criminal investigation, and those who have committed crimes should be prosecuted and convicted.""
 The Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are vowing to investigate, and other Democrats are calling on the Justice Department to do the same.
 ""You cannot destroy material if there is an ongoing investigation. There is a law against it,"" said Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
 At the White House, spokeswoman Dana Perino said President Bush only learned of the matter two days ago, after he was briefed by CIA Director Hayden.
 ""He has no recollection of being made aware of the tapes or their destruction before yesterday,"" said Perino.
 Perino defended the CIA interrogation program as legal and critical to national security. She said President Bush supports General Hayden's explanation that the tapes were destroyed to protect the identities of the interrogators.
 But the Senate's number two Democrat, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, rejected that argument:
 ""The defence of the CIA is that they wanted to protect the identity of those CIA employees who were engaged in the interrogation,"" said Durbin. ""Mr. [Senate] President, that is not a credible defence. We know that it is possible, in fact, easy, to cover the identity and faces of those who were involved in any videotape. Something more was involved here.""
 The tapes, which documented the use of tough interrogation techniques against key terror suspects in 2002, were destroyed three years later, at a time when there was increasing pressure from defence lawyers to obtain videotapes of detainee interrogations and as Congress had been probing allegations of torture.
 The Bush administration has maintained it does not use torture, but refuses to say what techniques are used by intelligence agencies in interrogations of terror suspects.

 NCA4 Volume 1, entitled ""Climate Science Special Report"" (CSSR), was released late last year, and Volume 2, entitled ""Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States"", on Friday. NCA4 is part of an ongoing series of NCA stand-alone reports updating the state of science on climate change and its potential physical impacts on the regions of the United States. The the third report was released in 2014.
 Changes in the United States highlighted in the report include worsening and more frequent landfalling atmospheric rivers — bands of rain-laden air in the sky. These rivers of water vapor tend to be around 300 miles (500 km) wide, carrying something like 25 times the water volume of the Mississippi River. They can cause extreme precipitation events and flooding. NCA4 also reported on increasing wildfires, such as the record California wildfires, high temperature extremes, retreating glaciers, and melting snow cover, the decline of sea ice, rising sea levels with increasing ocean acidification and coastal flooding. It describes how climate change would reportedly impact the US economy and quality of life if effective action is not taken to address climate change. The report says by the end of the 21st century, the United States economy may face a roughly ten percent loss of GDP. 
 A federal advisory committee was mandated to use the NCA reports' scientific studies, findings, and data to make public policy recommendations states could implement. In August 2017, the Trump administration dissolved this committee. NCA reports do not include policy recommendations. In a Reuters interview, a White House spokeswoman dismissed the report as inaccurate.
 The report was issued by thirteen federal agencies, including DOD and NASA, with NOAA as administrative lead. It was the result of two years' work. Three hundred scientists with a total of over a thousand people — half of which were non-governmental staff — worked on the report.

"," United States President Barack Obama spoke at a memorial in Tucson, Arizona Wednesday night, in the wake of last Saturday's mass shooting. Earlier in the day, Obama visited five people injured in the attack, including Gabrielle Giffords, a Democratic Congresswoman from Arizona.
 Obama spoke to almost 14,000 people in the University of Arizona's McKale Center, as well as 13,000 others outside. During a 33-minute-long speech, he attempted to begin the ""healing process,"" urging the nation ""to pause for a moment and make sure that we are talking with each other in a way that heals, not a way that wounds."" He recognized the victims of the incident as well as those who helped the wounded immediately after the shooting.
 Jared Lee Loughner, aged 22, is accused of opening fire on a ""Congress on Your Corner"" event on January 8, killing six people and injuring thirteen others. The incident has sparked a fiery political debate on whether intense political campaigns could incite violence.
 During his speech, Obama said of Giffords' condition, ""Gabby opened her eyes so I can tell you know she knows we are here, she knows that we love her and she knows that we are rooting for her through what will undoubtedly be a difficult journey."" Peter Rhee, a trauma surgeon at Tuscon's University Medical Center, said Giffords is making progress and is able to move more.

 ""He knows what it takes to fight this war effectively and he knows how to do it in a manner consistent with our laws and our Constitution,"" Bush said, while announcing Mukasey's nomination in the Rose Garden.
 ""I look forward to meeting with members of Congress in the days ahead and, if confirmed, to working with Congress to meeting our nation's challenges,"" Mukasey said in his comments.
 New York Senator Chuck Schumer, who was among those who sought the ouster of Gonzales, said Mukasey ""is certainly conservative,"" but ""seems to be the kind of nominee who would put rule of law first and show independence from the White House — our most important criteria.""
 Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said: ""A man who spent 18 years on the federal bench surely understands the importance of checks and balances and knows how to say no to the president when he oversteps the Constitution, but there should be no rush to judgment.

 Michael B. Mukasey was nominated as a federal district judge in Manhattan by President Ronald Reagan in 1987. He took the bench in 1988 and served in that position for 18 years, including a 6-year tenure as Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York from 2000 to July 2006.

 Obama said that ""the leaders of both parties in both chambers have reached an agreement that will reduce the deficit and avoid default, a default that would have had a devastating effect on our economy.""
 Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell expressed optimism that Congress will pass the compromise deal. The Senate vote is due on Tuesday.

"," United States President Barack Obama stated Monday that insurance giant AIG is in financial trouble due to ""recklessness and greed,"" and called for legal action to stop the company from giving out millions of dollars in bonuses to its executives.
 ""It's hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses, much less $165 million in extra pay,"" Obama said. ""How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat.""
 Obama's statement comes after reports surfaced last weekend saying the insurance agency, which is in deep financial trouble, had paid US$165 million to executives in bonuses, after receiving $170 billion as part of a government bailout plan.
 AIG has said that the bonuses have to be given out, as the company is legally required by contract to do so. A representative with the National Economic Council, Lawrence H. Summers, also said that the bonuses were required to be given out. If AIG had refused to give out the bonuses, employees could file a lawsuit against the company for the money.
 ""We cannot attract and retain the best and the brightest talent to lead and staff the A.I.G. businesses — which are now being operated principally on behalf of American taxpayers — if employees believe their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury,"" AIG CEO Edward M. Liddy said in a letter addressed to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner on Saturday.
 Liddy said that he asked Geithner ""to use that leverage and pursue every legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole.""
 ""I want everybody to be clear that Secretary Geithner's been on the case,"" Obama said. ""He's working to resolve this matter with the new CEO, Edward Liddy, who, by the way, everybody needs to understand, came on board after the contracts that led to these bonuses were agreed to last year.""
 If the bonuses cannot be stopped, the U.S. Congress says they want AIG to reimburse the government. Congress is looking to impose stiff new taxes on the pay, or ordering the company to return the money which was originally granted from a government bailout. In a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday, senator Richard Shelby promised that the treasury will recover all of the money. Several U.S. senators along with Liddy have sent letters to AIG asking for the bonuses to be renegotiated, something AIG agreed to and says they will reduce future bonuses by 30%. Senators state that if Libby does not respond by renegotiating the bonuses, the Senate Finance Committee will propose an excise tax. Not only will an excise tax be proposed on AIG, but all companies receiving bailout money and their employees who receive bonuses.
 Numerous House Democrats have introduced legislation which would place a 100% tax on any bonuses of over $100,000 from companies that are receiving government bailout funds. Meanwhile in the Senate, a bipartisan proposal by Max Baucus (D-Montana) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) would levy a special 90% excise tax on AIG's bonuses. Asked Senator Baucus, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee: ""What is the highest excise tax we can impose that will stand up in court? Let's find out.""

"," Anthony Weiner announced his resignation yesterday afternoon as a Democratic representative from New York to the U.S. House of Representatives, a position he has filled for twelve years. He has been under pressure from politicians within his own party after a sex scandal engulfed his life and that of the Democratic party.
 Weiner told reporters it was ""impossible"" to continue in his role after the events of the last few weeks, including revelations that he was involved in sexual relationships with a number of young women over the internet, including sending lewd photos of himself, and then lying about his actions to reporters.  
 He announced his resignation at a press conference in a Brooklyn senior center where 20 years ago he began his political career and apologized for his ""personal mistakes"". His wife, Huma Abedin, did not accompany him, but Weiner apologized to her in his speech, saying that he hopes ""most importantly, that my wife and I can continue to heal from the damage that I've caused."" He took no questions from reporters.
 On June 6, Weiner had admitted to corresponding with women he met on the internet, including  exchanging lewd photos. But on June 11 he declared  in an emotional interview he would not resign.  Under pressure from Democrats, Weiner  requested a two-week leave of absence from his position in order to obtain treatment to become ""a better husband and healthier person."" 
 However, Democratic politicians became increasingly anxious to put the growing scandal behind them, as it distracted members from more important issues such as problems with Medicare and the need for more jobs.  As the scandal gained momentum, a variety of politicians, including Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called on him to resign. President Barack Obama said he would resign if he were in Weiner's place in an interview with ABC News.
 ""Weiner exercised poor judgment in his actions and poor judgment in his reaction to the revelations,"" Pelosi said in a statement after Weiner announced his resignation. ""Today, he made the right judgment in resigning."" 
 The scandal came to light May 27 after Weiner accidentally sent a photograph of his crotch on his public stream on the social networking website Twitter, and then tried to cover it up by blaming hackers for posting the picture, denying all responsibility.
 Weiner later admitted sending online messages to other women, including to a 17-year-old high school student in Delaware, though a police investigation uncovered nothing illegal. On Wednesday, a former porn actress revealed that she had engaged in an online relationship with Weiner and that Weiner had asked her to lie about the nature of their contact. 
 More photos have continued to emerge, including one showing his nude genitals, and others showing him half naked. On Wednesday, the National Enquirer published images of Weiner cross-dressing while he was a college student at the State University of New York at Plattsburgh. In one photo, he is seen wearing a bra and pantyhose, while in another he is oiled and wearing swimming trunks.
 Colleagues  said Weiner wanted to wait for the return home of his wife, Abedin, before making a final career decision. He has been married for almost a year to Abedin, who is pregnant with the couple's first child. She is a top aide to Hillary Clinton, the Secretary of State, and the couple's wedding was presided over by former President Bill Clinton. She returned home to Washington, D.C. on Wednesday morning after having traveled with Clinton in the Middle East and Africa since June 8. 
 Weiner's district covers parts of Brooklyn and Queens, boroughs of New York City. He ran an unsuccessful campaign for mayor of New York City in 2005, and he was considered a potential candidate for future races. Known to be an outspoken supporter of liberal causes, he has irked conservatives and Democratic leaders. In 2009, he pushed for government-run health care, even though Obama had opposed the idea.

 All 100 senators were gathered in the Capitol building for a key procedural vote on health care reform legislation. All 58 Democrats in the Senate, plus the two independents who normally vote with them, voted for cloture, which limits the length of debate. All forty Republicans unanimously opposed the cloture.
 The bill would extend health insurance coverage to 30 million US residents who currently lack it, and forbid insurance companies from practices such as denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions.  Most residents would be required to purchase health insurance for the first time, with subsidies provided to those who cannot afford it. 
 ""We'll get this [bill] passed before Christmas and it will be one of the best Christmas presents this Congress has ever given the American people,"" said Democratic senator Tom Harkin.
 ""This country, the greatest and richest the world has ever seen, is the only advanced nation on earth where dying for a lack of health insurance is even possible,"" said Senate Majority leader Harry Reid.
 Most Republicans, however, said they believed the bill is too expensive and would not correct the current problems with the US's health care.
 If the bill passes in the Senate, that version will have to be merged with a more liberal version passed by the House of Representatives which includes a government-run alternative, not included in the Senate version.

The amendment would have revoked access to classified information from federal employees who disclose the information to unauthorized sources. This followed an attempt by Democratic Senators to strip White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove of his security clearance.
 The amendment comes as George W. Bush declined to reaffirm his pledge to fire any official involved in the leaking of covert CIA agent Valerie Plame after documents subpoenaed by the U.S. Supreme Court named his chief advisor Karl Rove as a source of the leak.
 In a press briefing on September 29th, 2004, White House spokesman Scott McClellan, in response to the question ""Scott, has anyone — has the president tried to find out who outed the CIA agent? And has he fired anyone in the White House yet?"", stated that ""The president has set high standards, the highest of standards for people in his administration. He's made it very clear to people in his administration that he expects them to adhere to the highest standards of conduct. If anyone in this administration was involved in it, they would no longer be in this administration."" [1] The next day, in a meeting with business people, George W. Bush said that ""If somebody did leak classified information, I'd like to know it, and we'll take the appropriate action."" [2] The New York Times [3] and The Washington Post [4] however, misrepresented Bush's promise as a promise to fire only those administration officials who ""knowingly"" or ""illegally"" disclosed Plame's identity.
 In a press conference this Monday, White House spokesman Scott McClellan was asked if the president stood by his statements made in September 2003, in light of recent evidence that Karl Rove was involved in the leak.  Scott McClellan declined to reaffirm this policy, citing an ongoing investigation.
 Pressed to explain its statements of two years ago that Rove wasn't involved in the leak, the White House refused to do so.
 ""If I were to get into discussing this, I would be getting into discussing an investigation that continues and could be prejudging the outcome of the investigation,"" White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.
 The statements made by Scott McClellan two years ago were made during the investigation that continues and may have prejudiced the outcome of the investigation.  When reporters asked McClellan to explain this inconsistency, McClellan gave the same response.  When asked if the Administration was told not to discuss the investigation while it was ongoing after he claimed that Karl Rove was not involved in the leak, and not before, Scott McClellan gave the same response.

"," US Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said that the Senate Finance Committee will vote on a sweeping health care reform bill next Tuesday. US President Barack Obama has made clear that extending health insurance coverage to as many Americans as possible is his top domestic priority.
 Republican lawmakers, however, are still overwhelmingly opposed to the bill, saying it is too expensive and would expand the role of government in people's health care.
 Obama and his fellow Democrats in the Senate received some good news late Wednesday from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which put the total cost of the Senate Finance Committee's health care bill at $829 billion over the next decade, below Obama's stated goal of $900 billion. The budget watchdog organization also said the health care bill would help reduce the federal budget deficit over the next ten years.
 Harry Reid said he believed health care reform was moving forward. ""And so today we stand closer than ever to fulfilling that fundamental promise, one for which we have fought for more than 60 years,"" he said.
 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, however said that the cost estimate was ""irrelevant"", because the final bill that will actually emerge from both houses of Congress is likely to look very different and cost a lot more. ""What matters is that the final bill will cost about a trillion dollars, vastly expand the role of government in people's health care decisions, increase premiums and limit choice,"" McConnell said.
 McConnell said Republicans favor a step by step approach to health care reform, focusing on prevention and wellness programs and dealing with the high costs of malpractice insurance doctors have to pay due to fears of excessive lawsuits.
 Under the Finance Committee's bill, US residents would be required to get health insurance or face a penalty, and insurance companies would face tough new regulations. For example, insurance companies could no longer reject coverage for people due to pre-existing conditions.
 The Senate Finance Committee is likely to pass the bill, which will then have to be merged with one passed by the Senate health committee before it goes to the full Senate floor for debate.

The highlighted comment made by Reid was calling Obama a ""light-skinned"" black man ""with no Negro dialect unless he wanted to have one."" The remarks were released in a book co-written by Time magazine reporter Mark Halperin, and New York magazine reporter John Heileman. 
 Reid has since apologized for ""using such a poor choice of words.""  President Obama quickly accepted the apology.  Reid has been a partner with the Obama Administration on issues such as health care reform.  Democratic Party chairman Tim Kaine told Meet the Press ""the comments were unfortunate and they were insensitive"", but ""I think the case is closed because President Obama has spoken directly with the leader [Reid] and accepted his apology. [...] We're moving on.""
 Members of the Republican Party have called on Reid to resign over his comments. Party chairperson Michael Steele told Fox News Sunday ""There is this standard where the Democrats feel that they can say these things and they can apologize when it ... comes from the mouths of their own. But if it comes from anyone else, it's racism,"". Having appeared alongside Kaine, where the Democrat Party chairman stated the case was closed, Steele argued that there was a double standard, on the basis of then-Senator Obama calling in 2002 calling for Trent Lott, at that time the majority leader, to be ousted for supporting the views of Strom Thurmond, who stood as a segregationist Presidential candidate in 1948.
 The book Game Change published today, also says that New York Senator Chuck Schumer encouraged Barack Obama to run in early 2006, even though he later endorsed his former colleague Hillary Clinton. Other revelations included that John McCain's aides were concerned about Sarah Palin's failure to understand basic facts prior to her ABC News interviews with Charles Gibson, including why North Korea and South Korea are separate countries.
 Co-authors Halpern and Heileman have a history of vocal criticism of media coverage of the 2008 Presidential election. In late 2008, Daily Kos reporter Jed Lewison drew attention to comments by Halpern, on-stage with Heilmen, asserting the reportage was, ""extreme bias, extreme pro-Obama coverage""; he characterised election coverage as, ""the most disgusting failure of people in our business since the Iraq war"". Halpern's centrepiece example was an analysis of New York Times profiles on the prospective First Ladies; overlooking earlier NYT coverage that reported on Obama's Caucasian ancestors being slave owners.

 The bill, which contains a ten-year plan with an estimated cost of US$829 billion, is aimed at lowering healthcare costs and increasing the affordability of insurance.  Proponents will now seek to merge it with another bill from the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.  Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus emphasized, ""Americans want us to craft a package that will get the 60 votes needed to pass.""  He argued that the Finance bill was the best candidate to attract needed the centrist support.
 Critics, however, have said that the proposed plan is too costly, and will cause the government to interfere too much into the private healthcare sector.
 ""We can now see clearly that the bill continues its march leftward,"" said the senior Republican on the committee, Senator Charles Grassley. ""This bill is already moving on a slippery slope to more government control of healthcare.""

"," In a vote of 74-25 last Thursday, the US Senate passed a measure that would change bankruptcy laws, making it harder for individuals seeking relief from their debt burden to avoid repayment. Almost twenty Democrats joined Republicans, who currently hold a majority of the seats in the US Senate, in passing the bill.
 Lobbyists for credit card companies and financial services firms have worked for the bill during the last two administrations. A similar measure passed both the Senate and House during the previous administration, but then President Bill Clinton pocket-vetoed the measure in 2000.
 Democrats sought to soften the bill by allowing bankruptcy filers to negotiate directly with lenders for relief, but the amendments were defeated by the Republican-controlled Senate.  Proponents of the bill claim the rise of bankruptcy filings to nearly 1.5 million a year shows that abusers of credit use the filings to shield themselves from irresponsible practices.
 ""There has been an explosion of bankruptcy,"" said Iowa Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley, the bill's sponsor. ""We preserve the principle of a fresh start, but we also establish a principle that if you have the ability to repay some of your debt, you are not going to get off scot-free.""  However, Massachusetts Democratic Sen., Edward M. Kennedy said, ""This legislation makes the bankruptcy courts of the United States the collection agency for the credit-card industry."" 
 The bill impacts a broad spectrum of bankruptcy law, but the most significant impact is on personal bankruptcy filings. Individuals who get behind in repaying credit card debt face high interest charges and stiff late payment fees.  By only meeting minimum payment requirements, borrowers remit to the lender over the life of the loan an amount in interest and other fees that can far exceed the value of the principal balance of the loan. This can put consumers who run up high balances on various cards at financial risk of default. Critics of the bill blame these aggressive lending practices as a contributing factor in the rising trend of bankruptcy filings from 1996.
 The proposed bill doesn't only affect debtors with credit card debt.
 It also affects debtors who have run up large medical bills.
 Patients with a past medical history that disqualifies them from full medical coverage, can easily find themselves facing insurmountable medical bills after just a short stay in the hospital. These individuals will no longer be able to get a fresh start after these personal disasters, and will be forced to live in poverty until they can pay off their medical bills as part of their Chapter 13 filing. (Prior to this bill, they would have been able to file Chapter 7, completely discharging their debt.)
 Chapter 7, which accounts for 70% of bankruptcy filings, allows individuals to eliminate most non-secured debts after liquidating assets, with the notable exemption of one's principle residence in most states. The Senate passed bill would change Chapter 7 eligibility by applying a means-test, where those with a median income higher than the state average would be required to file under Chapter 13 provisions. Under Chapter 13 protection, an individual's debt is not forgiven; rather it is restructured for payment under more lenient terms.
 This was the first major overhaul of federal bankruptcy law in many years.
 Under the old bankruptcy law, a personal  bankruptcy attorney could not be held financially responsible for his clients mendacity.  Under the new bankruptcy law, the bankruptcy attorney is responsible for his client's lies to the Court about his assets and the bankruptcy attorney and his insurance carrier can be held responsible by the Bankruptcy Court.
 The result is that personal bankruptcy attorneys (this does not apply to corporate bankruptcy attorneys) are likely to flee the personal bankruptcy field when the new law takes effect.  Their insurance companies will not offer the sort of coverage that they would need to continue to practice. 
 So when consumers need to file personal  bankruptcy under the new law, they will be unlikely to find a bankruptcy attorney to represent them.  Consumers will have to file pro se: such consumers will be likely to fail due to the complexity of the law.
 The bottom line is that the field of personal bankruptcy law as a practice area of law will cease to exist when the new bankruptcy law takes effect, and consumers will be unable to secure legal counsel and so consumers will lose what legal protections counsel now affords them.
 Under the new bankruptcy law about one half million Americans will be forest to pay for at lest 5 years on longer they will be held in servitude as chattel they will be completely subservient to a dominating influence of the company that holds the loan. Their loan will be put on the market for sale for profit.  The people will be forced to work harder. People who fail to go to court will have a arrest warrant  made out in their name and people who refuse
to pay. They will be subject to fines and or jail. About fifty thousand Americans will punished by a fine and or about three 
thousand Americans every year will go to jail under the new bankruptcy law. For some people this will be a third strike they will be put in jail for life.
 The bill has the support of President Bush, and its passage in the House sometime next month seems likely. If enacted into law, lending companies will recover more money on what otherwise would be written off as bad loans. Those persons of median and higher income seeking relief would be required to file under Chapter 13 status and pay up to $100 per month under court imposed conditions. It is expected the proposed changes would cause a sharp increase in filings before the new law could take effect.

"," The United States Senate passed a stimulus package worth US$838 billion on Tuesday, aimed at creating millions of new jobs and steering the economy out of the recession. The Democrat-controlled Senate passed the bill by a vote of 61-37, with only three Republicans supporting the plan. The move comes in the midst of a recession, which has claimed 3.6 million jobs in the US.
 Before the bill can be signed into law by the president, the Senate package first has to be reconciled with a different version of the plan that was adopted by the House of Representatives. The main differences between the two versions are over spending priorities and how to expand Medicaid, the medicinal program. The Senate version would also give more resources to tax cuts, whereas the House's plan would devote more money to local governments and schools.
 President Barack Obama welcomed the news, calling it a ""good start"". ""That's good news and I want to thank all of the members of the Senate who have moved the process forward,"" he said, speaking at a town hall meeting in Fort Myers. ""We've still got to get the House bill and the Senate bill to match up before it gets sent to my desk, so we got a little more work to do over the next couple of days.""
 Most Republicans voted against the stimulus package. Shortly before the Senate vote, Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell spoke against the stimulus plan, speaking for most of his Republican colleagues: ""This bill misses the mark. It is full of waste; we have no assurance it will create jobs or revive the economy,"" he said. ""The only thing we know for sure is that it increases our debt and locks in bigger and bigger interest payments every single year.""
 The only Republicans who voted for the bill were Senators Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, and Pennsylvania's Senator Arlen Specter.
 Wall Street reacted negatively to the passage of the bill, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down over three hundred points in afternoon trading.

"," The US Senate has postponed voting on a resolution to authorize limited US military operations in Libya, after Republican politicians said they wanted to focus on the national debt. 
 The resolution would have authorized a supporting role in the Libya conflict for up to a year. It specifically prohibited the deployment of US ground forces, and the use of US resources in reconstruction efforts. The administration of President Barack Obama has argued that congressional authorization is not needed, but welcomes a statement of support from the legislature. Last month, several US congressmen filed a lawsuit against the Obama administration, claiming its military operations in Libya are illegal because they did not have legislative approval.
 Majority Leader Harry Reid withdrew the motion yesterday as senators returned to work the day after the Independence Day holiday. The Senate was initially scheduled to enjoy a one-week recess, but Reid shortened it to restart negotiations to raise the federal borrowing limit and avoid a default on the nation's $14 trillion debt.
 A procedural vote to authorize military operations in Libya was scheduled for yesterday evening. Two Republicans raised their objections on the floor that afternoon, saying that if they had to skip their holiday recess, then they wanted to work on the debt crisis. Bob Corker of Tennessee claimed the House of Representatives previously rejecting a resolution to authorize US involvement in the Libya conflict meant Senate action was ""totally irrelevant"". 
 Democrats currently hold a majority in the 100-member Senate, but not the 60 votes needed to proceed to final votes. 
 Reid agreed that ""the most important thing for us to focus on this week is the budget"". Instead of the Libya resolution, the Senate will consider a non-binding resolution that urges the rich to ""make a more meaningful contribution to the deficit reduction effort"".
 Dianne Feinsten, a Democrat from California, is skeptical of the argument that the Senate cannot consider both issues simultaneously. Negotiations over the national debt have been taking place ""behind the scenes"", she said.

 Cots were brought in for the Senators to catch snatches of sleep during the long night, while some slept at their Washington, D.C. apartments for short periods of time. Pizza was brought in for senators to eat. Seven Democrats left the Senate floor to join a candlelight vigil held outside across the street from Congress.
 Had the bill passed, troops would have left Iraq 120 days after the vote, and would have been out of the country by April of 2008.
 Four Republican critics of the war — both of Maine's senators, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, together with Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Gordon Smith of Oregon — voted for the proposal. Collins' was a surprise vote; although a critic, she has not been favorable toward the deadline approach. Joe Lieberman, the Independent Democrat senator from Connecticut, who caucuses with Democrats, voted with Republicans against the motion, as he has done with all Iraq war legislation this year.
 Last night during the all-night senate debate, Democratic Majority Leader from Nevada, Harry Reid, asked that the Senate vote on the bill this morning. He later voted no on the motion in order to take advantage of Senate rules to reintroduce the measure.
 After the motion failed, Reid proposed that the Senate look at a series of Iraq proposals, including the failed plan, and make them subject to a simple majority vote. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Minority Leader from Kentucky objected, and Reid withdrew the legislation from the floor. The Senate then moved on to discussing student loans and grants.
 Throughout the night, the Senators took turns speaking in front of a large sign printed ""Let Us Vote"", speaking in favor of the amendment and against the Republicans for not allowing a simple majority vote. Republicans took turns decrying it, noting that Democrats did the same when they were the minority, and criticizing Democratic leaders.
 The following is a breakdown of how the Senators voted on the motion of cloture for the Levin/Reed Amendment (S.Amdt. 2087) grouped by state:

 Currently, the U.S. senate is pulling an all-night debate on the Iraq war to decide whether troops should be pulled out of the country.

 Opponents of the bill claim that to allow detainees those rights, the U.S. would potentially be engulfed in an endless line of lawsuits.

 The announcement follows months of rumours regarding the senator's retirement. Reid had denied that he would retire on numerous occasions, even after the rumours strengthened after he seriously injured himself exercising on January 1. The 75-year-old hurt ribs and an eye, suffering problems with his vision after the accident.
 To the Los Angeles Times, Reid spoke about his endorsement of Charles Schumer to replace him. He said ""Schumer, in 22 months, if he plays his cards right, should be able to do it[...] I told him if you need my help, you got it."" Another Senator talked about as a possible replacement is Dick Durbin, Senator from Illinois. 
 Reid made the announcement in a video. He said ""The decision I made has absolutely nothing to do with my injury, and it has nothing to do with my being majority leader, and it certainly has nothing to do with my ability to be reelected, because the path to reelection is much easier than it probably has been any time that I've run for re-election"".
 While Reid was giving a radio interview to Nevada Public Radio, President Barack Obama called in to pay tribute to the Senator. He said ""Harry is unique and he's got that curmudgeonly charm that is hard to replace. I'm going to miss him. But the good thing is that I'm going to leave this place at the same time.""
 Reid is to serve the remaining 22 months of his term through the end of 2016. He served in the Senate from 1987, and before that in the House from 1983. He has held the position of Senate Democratic leader since 2005.

"," Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is the lone holdout preventing a vote on synthetic marijuana legislation in the US Senate through a procedural block that is allowed under the rules. Until Paul lifts his block, the Senate will not be able to act on legislation that has already passed the US House of Representatives last December.  Wikinews has investigated the block on the legislation.
 Synthetic marijuana can be sold over the counter in some places and it is commonly known by brand names, such as ""K2"" or ""Spice"". Other types of synthetic ""designer"" drugs, like ""bath salts"", belong to a class of substances that are in some cases legal, though they create a health hazard, because they are declared not meant for human consumption.
 At issue in the legislation is the amount of chemical substances banned, the criminalization of substances, the authority of the federal versus the state government to makes those decisions, the extent to which the product is a threat or hazard to public health and safety, and the effect such a law would have on the research of these substances. All of these issues were debated in the House. Paul has made an issue of the long prison sentences for marijuana. His critics claim he is going too far by blocking legislation. Paul, a Republican who has libertarian leanings, has argued that the states should have the authority to ban drugs.
 According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 31 states have a ban on both synthetic cannabinoids and substituted cathinones while 39 states have a ban on synthetic cannabinoids. Rand's home state of Kentucky bans both. But legislation is not a perfect solution; in Cass County, Michigan, four teenagers between the ages of 13 and 14 had an emergency after using synthetic marijuana, but even though Michigan bans both, police are not sure that the substances are illegal. Chemists have to conduct tests on the products.
 Although Paul is framing the issue as a legal one, the medical community has turned its attention to this new phenomenon's impact on public health and safety. In an article that appeared in the March 2012 issue of Pediatriacs, medical researchers led by Dr. Joanna Cohen analyzed the cases of three teens who were hospitalized and treated as emergencies after an incident of synthetic marijuana use. One 16-year-old girl lost her motor skills and was unresponsive yet she had an exceptionally high heart rate and abnormal blood pressure. An 18-year-old boy was extremely sweaty, had a high heart rate and was agitated. And a 16-year-old boy had a speech dysfunction, as well as symptoms of agitation and confusion. The doctors who wrote the study say people are using this product because they believe it can give them a high similar to marijuana, however, the new drug can bring on both psychological symptoms, like psychosis and paranoia, and physical ones, such as convulsions.
 One out of every nine high school students has reported use of synthetic marijuana, according to Monitoring the Future released in December 2011. The annual survey can be used to spot new trends in substance use among youth and the report included synthetic marijuana for the first time in 2011.
 Poison centers noticed a sharp increase in calls reporting incidents due to synthetic marijuana. According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, in 2010 centers nationwide took 2,906 calls for synthetic marijuana cases, but by 2011, they took 6,959 calls. The problem is noticeable to local health officials, like in Syracuse, New York, which is Senator Chuck Schumer's state, where 120 cases were reported and one health professional called it ""a significant public health concern."" New York has a ban on substituted cathinones but not synthetic canabanoids, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
 Although the US Drug Enforcement Agency placed five substances that fall under synthetic marijuana into Schedule I on March 1, 2011, its emergency powers only last one and a half years and its ban has not stopped other substances from being used instead. Schedule I is a running list of banned chemicals.
 Three of Paul’s Senate senior colleagues say Paul should drop his block. Senators Chuck Grassley, Chuck Schumer, and Amy Klobuchar are sponsoring bipartisan legislation that aims to ban synthetic marijuana as a serious health threat. The legislation is bipartisan as Grassley is a Republican , while both Schumer and Klobuchar are Democrats. Senator Schumer, in an editorial for the New York Daily News, advocated tackling synthetic marijuana at the national level rather than at the state. Schumer’s argument is that states have tried to ban the ingredients commonly found these products but the manufacturers have the flexibility to alter the ingredients to bypass the law. Schumer said the federal government needs a proactive rather than a reactive stance against drugs. ""All we need is one senator, Rand Paul of Kentucky, to release his block on this legislation,"" wrote Schumer. ""We’re urging him to do the right thing, and let us move forward with a vote.""
 Before the Senate took up the issue, similar legislation had already passed in the House. The House voted 317–98 in favor of the Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2011 on December 8, 2011. Pennsylvania Congressperson Charles Dent sponsored the legislation that would add ingredients found in synthetic marijuana to Schedule I. Dent’s legislation included chemicals that are not even found in the United States at this time, but he argues that synthetic marijuana is too great of a public health threat to dismiss.
 Standing in opposition to the legislation, Virginia Congressperson Bobby Scott and several fellow Democrats argued Dent's legislation was bypassing a process for the banning of drugs that was already in place and established. Scott also argued some of the substances banned by the legislation were not even present in the United States but so far only in Europe. His colleagues argued researchers would lose the ability to conduct research freely on these substances and, as Scott noted, the legislation was seeking to ban substances but without any research to back it up.
 Grassley's legislation is named for David Rozga, an Iowan who committed suicide after using synthetic marijuana. In his speech, before the Senate, Grassley said Rozga's situation inspired him to put forward the legislation.
 For some families, the issue has also become an emotional one, as they have lost a loved one. Karen Dobner, a mother from Aurora, Illinois, is blaming Senator Paul for any deaths that may still occur because he is holding up a legislative solution to a problem that she says killed her own son. When her son Max was in college, he tried a synthetic marijuana product and had a panic attack. Dobner believes the car crash that killed her son would not have happened had he not been experiencing the symptoms of the designer drug. Now Dobner keeps calling Paul's office begging him to stop his hold.
 Senator Paul's office was contacted by both phone and email about this report but it did not respond.

"," At least 15 United States senators from both the Democratic and Republican parties voiced strong support for sanctions against Iran unless it halts its nuclear program completely, and at least one senator has hinted that military action is a possibility in the future. 
 Senator John McCain (R-Arizona), said on CBS that ""The United States should press for sanctions even if that led to higher oil prices."" He also added that ""this is the most grave situation that we have faced since the end of the Cold War, absent the whole war on terror.""
 Another Republican Senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, speaking on the Fox News Channel, said there should be ""tougher measures."" He also stated that ""all options should be kept open,"" which could imply the use of military force. However, Senator Graham also said that ""we need to work together with our European allies.""
 The most well-known military action by the US against an elected government in Iran was the Anglo-American covert Operation Ajax in 1953 in which Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh was overthrown and the exiled Shah was restored to the throne as a dictator.
 Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-California), said she ""agrees with McCain's assessment of the extent of Iran's threat. Iran has much more opportunity to create devastation in the Middle East than Iraq at this time,"" she said. ""I think it's a very serious threat."" Regarding the need for continued international cooperation, Feinstein stated that the issue is a ""major test of the international community.""
 On Thursday, Germany, France, Great Britain and the European Union officially declared an end to negotiations with Iran, a move endorsed by The United States.
 On Friday, Russia renewed its call for Iran to resume cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 
 ""We again call on Iran to reconsider its decisions and return to the state of moratorium and implement full and transparent cooperation with the IAEA, as is foreseen in the appropriate resolutions of the agency's board,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Mikhail Kamynin said in a statement to the press.
 Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov said ""all efforts must be made to ensure the peaceful resolution of the crisis and that diplomatic methods had not been exhausted."" He then added that Russia's ""proposal"" to move the final phase of Iran's enrichment program to Russian territory is ""still on the table for discussion.""
 Mohamed ElBaradei, Chief of the IAEA, said in a press release today that he is so far unable to confirm whether Iran's controversial nuclear program is peaceful. ""For the last three years we have been doing intensive verification in Iran, and even after three years I am not yet in a position to make a judgment on the peaceful nature of the (nuclear) program."" He also added that Iran would only be a ""few months from building a nuclear bomb if it has nuclear material at the same time as a weaponization program.""
 ""We still need to assure ourselves through access to documents, individuals and locations, that we have seen all that we ought to see and that there is nothing fishy, if you like, about the (nuclear) program,"" ElBaradei said.
 Iranian Finance Minister Davood Danesh Jafari said on an Iranian radio station today that ""any Western sanction placed on Iran, in response to its nuclear development program could raise global oil prices... sanctions on Iran, could possibly, by disturbing Iran's political and economic situation, raise oil prices beyond levels the West expects,"" he told state radio.
 On Saturday, the Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said during a rare press conference to address the European Union that Iran will ""consider using its control over oil prices as retalliation for potential sanctions on Iran."" Today he said, ""only diplomacy, not threats to refer it to the U.N. Security Council, could defuse a standoff.""
 In a press conference on Friday, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan said that he had spoken to the Iranian representative in the IAEA in Vienna, Ali Laridziani, who said ""Iran is interested in serious and constructive negotiations, but without time constraints.""
 The United States and the E.U. harshly criticized Annan's ""spin"" on the Iranian response, stating that because diplomatic talks have reached their limit, the matter should be deferred to the Security Council.
 Iran continues to insist that its nuclear energy is to be used to provide electricity for an ""energy-needy economy, not to build (atom) bombs.""
 Iran announced on January 10, 2006, that it was going to ""resume full nuclear research.""

"," Yesterday afternoon, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, announced that she would be launching an impeachment inquiry into the conduct of United States President Donald Trump. Pelosi had previously opposed impeachment proceedings.
 Pelosi called Trump's conduct a ""breach of his Constitutional responsibilities,"" according to NBC. ""[T]he House of Representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry,"" she announced. Specifically, she was directing six of the House's committees to ""proceed with their investigations under [the] umbrella"" of impeachment. 
 Members of the House Judiciary Committee do not all agree on how impeachment inquiries work. Republican committee member Doug Collins of Georgia said on Twitter, ""Until the full House votes to authorize an inquiry, nobody is conducting a formal inquiry."" Democratic committee chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York has repeatedly maintained an impeachment inquiry is what the committee is already doing.
 The New York Times reported that, in a phone call in late July, Trump might have encouraged newly elected Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of Joe Biden, who served as Vice President from 2008 until 2016. Joe Biden is a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for the 2020 presidential election. Trump characterized the call with Zelensky as ""perfectly fine and routine.""
 Trump, responding to Pelosi's announcement via Twitter, attacked the impeachment investigation as ""Witch Hunt garbage.""
 Impeachment is the process by which a federal official, including the president, can be removed from office by Congress. The United States Constitution specifies that officials are removed from office after being impeached for, and convicted of, ""Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."" A simple majority of the House of Representatives is needed to impeach an official, who can then be removed from office after a trial in the Senate, if two-thirds of the senators vote for removal.
 In the history of the United States, only two presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton. Johnson was impeached over perceived violations of the Tenure of Office Act of 1867, which the Supreme Court later ruled to be unconstitutional. The vote to remove him from office failed by one vote. In 1998, Clinton was impeached for lying to investigators and obstructing justice during the Lewinsky affair; the vote to remove him also failed. A third president, Richard Nixon, would have faced impeachment over the Watergate scandal but resigned before any impeachment vote.

"," British Prime Minister Tony Blair bowed to pressure from within his own Labour Party today by publicly confirming he will resign within a year. ""I would have preferred to do this in my own way,"" said Blair who added ""the next party conference in the next couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader."" However, he refused to name the specific date of his resignation, ""The precise timetable has to be left to me and has to be done in the proper way,"" Blair insisted. ""I'm not going to set a precise date now. I don't think that's right. I will do that at a future date, and I will do that in the interests of the country.""
 He apologised for the party's conduct this week saying it ""has not been our finest hour, to be frank"". 
 Demands that Blair announce his resignation plans have mounted over the past few months particularly over concerns about the Prime Minister's strong support for Israel during the Israel-Hezbollah war, the perception that he is a loyal follower of United States President George W. Bush and a precipitous slide in Labor's support in public opinion polls where the party is now at a 16 year low. 
 Yesterday, eight Labour MPs resigned from their junior government positions over Blair's refusal to announce his retirement. They had previously been considered staunch Blairites. The British press reports of a shouting match yesterday between Blair and his likeliest successor, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown over the handover date. 
 ""I want to make it absolutely clear today that when I met the prime minister yesterday, I said to him, as I have said on many occasions to him and I repeat today, that it is for him to make the decision,"" Brown said. 
 ""I said also to him, and I make clear again today, that I will support him in the decisions he makes, that this cannot and should not be about private arrangements but what is in the best interests of our party and, most of all, the best interests of our country.""
 Despite Blair's announcement, several MPs expressed their dissatisfaction at his refusal to name a precise date and demanded that he leave sooner rather than later. 
 Manchester Blakeley MP Graham Stringer told the BBC if Blair ""thought it was going to take the politics out of the next nine months that simply is not going to happen"". 
 MP Doug Henderson said ""It doesn't seem to me that the public knows any more about the PM's retirement plans. People keep saying to me that the Labour party must have a clear direction forward with clear priorities and a new leader before the May 2007 (regional) elections."" 
 The eight MPs who resigned as junior ministers or parliamentary secretaries, Wednesday, expressed a concern in their resignation letter that Blair needed to go soon in order not to harm the party's prospects in next May's elections to the Scottish parliament, Welsh assembly and English local authorities.
 Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 when Labour defeated the Conservative government of John Major. He has led the party to three majority victories and promised before the last election that his third term would be his last.

"," Demands that the British Prime Minister Tony Blair set a date for his departure as leader of the British Labour Party reached a new level today as seven government members resigned to protest his continued leadership. 
 Junior Minister Tom Watson and six Parliamentary Private Secretaries had previously been considered loyal Blair supporters. Wayne David, Ian Lucas, Mark Tami and David Wright, the resigning PPSs, signed a letter stating their concern that the ongoing leadership crisis would hurt Labour at next year's elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and English Local Authorities. Two others, David Mole and Khalid Mahmood have also resigned as PPSs. Parliamentary Private Secretaries are Members of Parliament appointed to assist Cabinet ministers. Blair responded by calling Watson ""disloyal, discourteous and wrong.""
 Watson told BBC News he no longer believes it is in the best interests of the country for Blair to continue as prime minister. 
 The resignations come in spite of a report in The Sun newspaper quoting unnamed friends of the prime minister saying he would resign as Labour leader on May 31, 2007. The report has not been confirmed by Blair or his office. 
 Earlier this week at least 14 MPs who were first elected in 2001 and were  previously thought loyal to Blair, including Watson and the 6 PPSs, signed a confidential letter to Blair calling on him to publicly announce a date for his resignation. The letter was leaked to the press. 
 Conservative Leader of the Opposition David Cameron responded to the resignations by saying the government was ""divided and in meltdown"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said that the national interest was ""not being served by the continuing uncertainty over Mr Blair"" and that the prime minister ""should either resign or set a date."" 
 The mounting crisis comes two weeks before the party's annual conference being held this year in Manchester.

"," Over the course of the last week, fifteen people who have suffered from influenza have died in Wales, as reported to the Welsh Assembly Government. The total amount of flu-related deaths in Wales since October 2010 has now increased to 27.
 On Tuesday, 49 people were being treated in critical care beds in hospitals around Wales, according to health officials. With twelve reported admissions, Aneurin Bevan Local Health Board had the highest amount of critical care patients in Wales. Betsi Cadwaladr University Local Health Board has the second highest total number of patients experiencing this critical care in the country, with eleven being cared for. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board and Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board have nine important care admissions each. Cwm Taf NHS Trust contains five of such patients, while Hywel Dda NHS Trust has three.
 The age group of 25–34 years old had the largest amount of meetings with general practitioners; the rate of consultation was 147 people for every 100,000. For all age groups, 93 people out of every one hundred thousand have been consulting with a GP; on January 5, the total figure stood at 85 meetings per 100,000.
 ""Despite the slight increase in the clinical consultation rate for influenza this week compared to the previous week, the rate of consultations for flu-like illness in Wales still remains within the levels of normal seasonal flu activity,"" said Dr. Tony Jowell, the Chief Medical Officer of Wales. ""Most healthy people will recover from flu-like illnesses within five to seven days with plenty of rest and drinking non-alcoholic fluids. On the issue of vaccination against seasonal flu, whilst we have been working to make stocks of the vaccine that was developed against swine flu available to be used where supplies of seasonal flu vaccine have run low, we are now well into the flu season.""
 According to Media Wales, 13 patients experiencing flu-related symptoms were getting treatment at Withybush General Hospital in Haverfordwest on Tuesday. Meanwhile, five were receiving hospital treatment at Bronglais General Hospital in Aberystwyth. Also, Carmarthenshire NHS Trust in Llanelli and West Wales General Hospital in Carmarthen both had a solitary patient.
 Jowell also commented: ""People in at-risk groups are at a higher risk of complications from seasonal flu, and the best protection is early vaccination. A press and publicity campaign has been running since October and has included television, radio and bus adverts to let people know if they are in an at-risk group, and that the vaccine is available free of charge to those groups from GPs. We have also encouraged health boards and GPs to ensure that their patients and front line NHS staff are vaccinated against seasonal flu.""
 Throughout the United Kingdom, 62 individuals reportedly died in the last week, as the result of suffering from influenza. The majority of these victims were suffering from swine flu. In most of these cases, the sufferers were aged between 15 and 64. However, nine of the fatalities were of children aged below fourteen.

 South Wales Plaid Cymru AM Jocelyn Davies, a member of the Welsh Assembly Government,  pointed out that the decision ""means that deaf British Sign Language users in Wales will no longer have access to local news"". Liberal Democrat AM Eleanor Burnham went further, saying it was ""an outrageous decision which it seems has been taken without any consultation with deaf people at all, which is appalling"".
 ITV Wales announced that they were ""discontinuing the signed 20 second headlines every weekday"" after 23 years and that doing so would bring the Welsh local news programme Wales Tonight ""in line with all other ITV regions"". They added that ""ITV will continue to meet its licence obligations for signing across its family of channels"" and that the bulletin would keep its optional subtitling. The move apparently has the blessing of media regulator Ofcom.
 The Wales Deaf Broadcasting Council said that it was a ""severe blow"" and that it was ""very concerned that no consultation with the deaf community has taken place about this decision, neither by ITV Wales nor Ofcom"".
 Plaid's Adam Price said ""I am... concerned about the very short notice given for implementation of this decision. I hope that this is not an attempt by ITV Wales to achieve a fait accompli"".
 ITV has been scaling back its public service broadcasting commitments recently, saying it wished to stop producing and airing local news at all. Ofcom has already allowed the weekly amount of news on ITV Wales to fall from five hours and twenty minutes to four hours.

"," Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats and deputy prime minister in the United Kingdom coalition government, has today conceded a ""bitter blow"" after suffering two major defeats as the electorate rejected the alternative vote system and his party was battered by its worst local election defeat in 30 years. The SNP also won the historic first majority vote in the history of Scotland, which will pave the way for a referendum on independence.
 The electorate overwhelmingly rejected the alternative vote; 68 percent voting ""no"" to 32 percent voting ""yes"". The rejection was the second defeat for the Liberal Democrat leader today after the party also lost seats across the country. Gary Long, leader of the Liberal Democrats on Nottingham City Council, who lost his seat to Labour today, has publicly called for Clegg to resign after the electoral defeats. The Liberal Democrat mayor of Chorley accused Clegg of ""letting the party down"", and a third party leader said he should ""think about his position"".
 Clegg, who campaigned to implement the alternative vote, was today forced to concede his party had taken a disappointing loss in failing to win the alternative vote, and sustained ""big knocks"" in the council elections because it was ""getting the brunt of the blame"" for spending cuts implemented by the coalition. While it was a good day for the Conservatives—who gained two more council seats—Clegg had lost almost half his council seats, many to Labour. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, said the backlash against Clegg sent ""a clear message"" to the Liberal Democrats ""that there needs to be a change of direction on some of the key issues"". Many families who rejected his party, Clegg said, feared a return to Thatcherism. ""We need to get up, dust ourselves down and move on,"" he said.
 But tonight leading ""yes"" campaigners admitted they had been defeated. Chris Huhne, a Liberal Democrat minister who campaigned in support of the alternative vote, said: ""The rejection has been overwhelming and we accept that."" He said the public had resoundingly rejected the alternative vote, and suggested any attempt ""to find some sort of backdoor method to bring something in that is not first past the post will be seen to have snubbed the clear wishes of the electorate."" Counting of the ballots, which were cast yesterday across the country, is continuing tonight, but the ""no"" vote has already passed the winning post. Voter turnout was a higher-than-expected 41 percent.
 As turmoil spreads within the Liberal Democrats, there are also reports of tension between the two coalition parties—Clegg campaigned in support of the system, but his Conservative coalition partner David Cameron campaigned against it. Although senior politicians within the coalition insist there are no differences after the campaign over the alternative vote, differences are thought to be mounting within the government. Paddy Ashdown, a former Liberal Democrat leader, today said the ""goodwill and trust"" between the coalition parties had all but dissolved.
 In Scotland, the SNP won a majority vote for the first time in the history of the country after the Liberal Democrat vote collapsed and Labour suffered an unpredicted defeat, allowing the party leader, Alex Salmond, to hold a referendum on Scottish independence. ""Just as the Scottish people have restored trust in us, we must trust the people as well,"" he said. ""Which is why, in this term of the parliament, we will bring forward a referendum and trust the people on Scotland's own constitutional future."" Following a series of defeats for senior Labour politicians in Scotland the party leader, Iain Grey, announced his resignation. Cameron congratulated Salmond for his ""emphatic win"", but said he would fight Scottish independence ""with every single fibre that I have.""
 Vote counting has begun in Northern Ireland, but the full layout of the Assembly will not be known before tomorrow evening. Meanwhile, Labour missed out on an overall majority in the Welsh Assembly by one seat; it now appears they may form an alliance with the Liberal Democrats. Carwyn Jones, the leader of the Labour party in Wales said the electorate wanted them to govern, but refused to dismiss the prospect of an alliance. ""The one thing the people of Wales have said very clearly to us is they want Labour to stand up for them and they want Labour to lead the next Welsh government,"" he said. ""Over the next few days all the parties will be considering their positions. The opposition parties have had some severe disappointments and things need to settle before they think about their position.""

"," The Scottish National Party (SNP), which supports Scottish independence from the UK, has pulled off a historic, albeit narrow, victory in yesterday's Scottish elections.
 In the third Scottish election since the opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999, the left of centre SNP beat the ruling Labour Party by a single seat. It won 47 seats, while Labour won 46, down from the current 50.
 It is the first time since the parliament opened that Labour has been beaten, and the first time in fifty years that they have not had a majority of Scottish constituency seats in any election.
 SNP leader Alex Salmond declared: ""Scotland has changed for good and forever."" He added that the Labour Party had ""lost the moral authority to govern Scotland.""
 The current First Minister of Scotland, Jack McConnell of Labour said: ""While I recognise that the SNP are the largest party by the narrowest of margins, Alex Salmond must himself recognise that he does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament or anywhere near a majority of the vote.""
 It is believed that many factors caused the Labour vote to slump and the SNP vote to rise, including the war in Iraq and the renewal of Trident, which are both unpopular in Scotland.
 The election also raises a serious dilemma for the Labour party's Gordon Brown, a Scotsman widely tipped to succeed Tony Blair as the next prime minister of the United Kingdom. Brown is vehement in his support of the Union, and is a Westminster (London parliament) MP for Kirkcaldy. An SNP government in Scotland will find itself facing the very Labour party it beat in power in London. 
 Turnout was up 2% on the last Scottish election.
 The election was highly controversial, not least for having three separate systems, running in tandem -
 The three systems, along with difficulties with electronic counting meant that maybe as many as one hundred thousand ballot papers were ""spoiled"". In addition, there was also huge problems with the postal vote.
 Due to the extensive computer problems, votes had to be cancelled early on Friday morning, and postponed to later in the day.
 Many other problems beset the election, with a helicopter from the Western Isles constituency being held up by fog, and a boat carrying ballot papers from the Isle of Arran, breaking down in the Firth of Clyde.
 In addition to the SNP and Labour, the other parties results' were as follows -
 The Scottish Socialist Party, Solidarity and the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party were all wiped out.
 In order to establish a majority in the Scottish Parliament, the SNP must form a coalition with one or more of these parties. The Liberal Democrats, who were in coalition with the Labour party in the first two terms of the Scottish parliament, are a possibility.
 Other parties that campaigned for seats in Holyrood included the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP), the British National Party (BNP), the Scottish Unionist Party, the Scottish Socialist Labour Party, the Christian Peoples Alliance and the Scottish Christian Party.
 The Scottish National Party, while not gaining the landslide it had wished for, made breakthroughs in Glasgow (Govan), Edinburgh (Edinburgh East) and also took both seats in Dundee.
 The Liberal Democrats gained seats in Dunfermline West, but their losses mean the number of seats they hold is unchanged.
 While the Scottish election was going on, the Welsh were also having their election for the Welsh Assembly. Plaid Cymru gained a seat from Labour at Llanelli. The Conservatives had their best showing since the Assembly began.
 The final results show that the membership for the new assembly will be:- 
 Labour             26  -4
Plaid Cymru        15  +3
Conservatives      12  +1
Liberal Democrats  6   -
Independent        1   -
 In England, the elections were more minor, dealing only with local authorities. However they can be an important indicator of how battleground seats might go in the General Election, expected in 2-3 years time.  The Conservatives made the greatest gains, but did not make the breakthrough in Northern England that they would have hoped. The Liberal Democrats did not make the advances that they had hoped, and stayed at more or less the same level. Elsewhere, Cornish regionalists Mebyon Kernow gained an extra seat bringing their total to seven, and the Eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and Liberal Party (not to be confused with the Liberal Democrats) gained seats in several areas of England.

"," Seven people in Wales have died as a result of the H1N1 swine flu virus.  This increases the total number of people who have died from the virus in that country to 21.  Dr. Tony Jewell, chief medical officer for Wales, had said that this was expected to happen.
 He said: ""The four UK Health Ministers have agreed that the second phase of the swine flu vaccination programme should focus on all children aged six months and over and under five years. Evidence shows that young children are suffering the greatest overall impact from the disease. They are particularly vulnerable to complications and more likely to become seriously ill and need hospital treatment than other groups. Sadly, this week, we have seen a further increase in swine flu-related deaths. However, we are aware that a number of these people had been seriously ill for some time. This is a tragedy for the families and friends of the individuals but unfortunately, we have been expecting to see an increase in the number of deaths. This is the same for seasonal flu in the winter.""
 The Welsh Assembly Government have said that they knew of somebody who was in Wales from another country dying from an illness related to swine flu. Dr. Jewell also said: ""Whilst reported cases of swine flu have recently started declining, it is too early to draw any conclusions about the number of future cases.""

"," The United Kingdom electorate took to the polls yesterday to vote in both local elections and a UK-wide referendum regarding the system used to elect its members of parliament to the House of Commons. The polls opened at 07:00 BST (0600 UTC) yesterday morning and closed at 22:00 BST (2100 UTC) last night.
 Alongside the normal local elections for seats on 279 councils, and elections for seats in the devolved Scottish Parliament and the Welsh and Northern Irish Assemblies, the country saw the first nation-wide referendum since 1975, regarding potentially replacing the current first past the post voting system with the Alternative Vote (AV) system currently used for general elections in Australia, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea, as well as for some mayoral and party leadership elections worldwide, including in the UK.
 Mayoral elections also took place in Leicester, Mansfield, Beford, Middlesbrough, and Torbay. Some areas also experienced elections to parish councils, while the constituency of Leicester South underwent a by-election after its Labour MP Sir Peter Soulsby stood down to run for mayor.
 One polling station in Stockport was delivered the wrong ballot papers, causing around 90 people to cast invalid votes. Those affected were, where possible, contacted and asked to cast their vote again, according to the local council. Another, in Llandeilo, was closed for two hours after escaped dogs bit four people nearby.
 The AV referendum came about as a result of the coalition agreement between the Liberal Democrats, who support voting reform and promised a referendum in their campaign, and the Conservatives, who initially opposed reform but agreed to a referendum as a compromise, following the election in May last year.
 The Scottish National Party (SNP) hopes to retain control of the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, where it currently runs the minority government, in the hopes of potentially holding a referendum regarding Scottish independence, which they did not deliver in their first term in power; meanwhile Labour hope to end their coalition with Plaid Cymru by taking control of the Welsh Assembly; however, sources from within the party report that it is likely that Labour will fail to reach a majority. Little is expected to change in Ireland, where the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin are expected to retain their dominance over the Northern Irish Assembly.
 Polls taken prior to the election implied that AV would be rejected by some margin, but due to low turnout — despite good weather — the results are likely to be unpredictable. The results of the AV referendum are not due to be declared until 20:00 BST (1900 UTC) today, and counting is not due to begin until 16:00 BST (1500 UTC).
 As usual, Sunderland was the first council to report, and was held by Labour; as is the case with many councils in the north of England, it is considered a Labour safe seat. Early predictions indicate that a number of Liberal Democrat councilors in northern cities will lose their seats to Labour or Conservative candidates. Former Labour Home Secretary David Blunkett reportedly said that  the national opinion had changed from ""Clegg mania"" into ""Clegg pneumonia"". In an interview with the BBC, Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg put predicted Liberal Democrat losses down to voters being ""angry"" at the coalition government, but also said that the electorate is ""not stupid"", and would vote in council elections based on local—rather than national—factors.
 The first Scottish Parliament constituency to report was Rutherglen, which is held by the incumbent Labour MP, James Kelly. Despite being considered Labour's fourth safest Scottish seat, it experienced a swing of more than seven percent towards the SNP, and large Labour losses are predicted across Scotland. Nearby East Kilbride was the second to report, and was gained by SNP candidate Linda Fabiani from the Labour incumbent Andy Kerr.

"," A committee of Welsh Assembly politicians has called for an extensive programme of works to upgrade the railways in Wales, saying that Wales is not being treated fairly in comparison with other parts of the United Kingdom.  However, one academic who gave evidence to the committee says that the proposals, if implemented in full, would cost about £5 billion (more than US$8 billion), and it is unclear whether this level of public finance will be available.
 The Enterprise and Learning Committee made a number of recommendations to improve the rail service within Wales, and between Wales and England.  It calls for better links between the north and south of Wales, high-speed links from Wales to other parts of the UK, and light rail systems for the southern cities of Cardiff, Swansea and Newport.
 Other suggestions include upgrading the Severn Tunnel between south Wales and England, electrifying the line along the north Wales coast, and new carriages, especially on routes serving the valleys of south Wales. Improved access for passengers with disability is another area where the committee wants action. It also calls for more decision-making powers about railway matters to be transferred to the devolved government in Wales.
 The committee, which took two months to look over the report, said that it was concerned that passenger satisfaction with the service was lower in Wales than elsewhere. In addition, investment was needed to meet an anticipated increase in demand for passenger and freight services. It wants the possibility of reopening closed lines, or building new lines, to be examined.
 Committee chairman Gareth Jones said that the report ""examines the long-term future of the rail network in Wales"", adding, ""The evidence we have gathered indicates that freight and passenger traffic on our network will increase over the coming years. The objective hopefully will be that Wales benefits from this extra traffic so that we are better placed in terms of high speed link connections with the rest of the UK and Europe. It is important that the Welsh government provides for that extra demand.""
 Commenting on the report, Profesor Stuart Cole from the University of Glamorgan said that although the plans were ambitious, the committee had ""set out very clearly what is required if you’re going to get a 21st century railway"". The 21 recommendations would cost £5bn in total, with the three light rail schemes taking about one-third of that total, in his view.  
 Other improvements, for example between the north and south of Wales, could be achieved at a lesser price.  Cole, who gave evidence to the committee, says that ""for an expenditure of £50m spread over three years we could get the journey time from Llandudno to Cardiff down from four hours to three hours and 20 minutes.”
 The Welsh Assembly Government will give its full response to the report at a later date. A spokesman said that a modern railway was ""crucial"" for Wales, and commented that the Assembly Government agreed with many of the recommendations.  Network Rail, which manages railway tracks in Wales and elsewhere in Great Britain, said that it would already be spending more than £1.5bn on infrastructure over the next five years, with improvements to over 120 stations planned.

"," Highland Airways, which runs flights between Anglesey in north Wales and Cardiff in south Wales, has said today that it is business as usual, despite suspending online booking yesterday.  Meanwhile, Liberal Democrats have called on the Welsh Assembly Government to withdraw the £800,000 annual public subsidy for the route (about US$1.3 million) and use the money on ""green public transport"" instead.
 Although flights were continuing and passengers were told to ""check in as normal"", the company stopped taking bookings for future flights yesterday, blaming ""technical difficulties"".  However, it also said that trading conditions were ""difficult"".  The company's commercial director, Basil O'Fee, explained that the company's problems had been ""exacerbated by the severe winter and resultant reduced flying and reduced income."" He added that the board was in talks with potential new investors, and hoped for a outcome of these discussions to be known ""within days rather than weeks"".
 ""It is now time to end this costly debacle before even more public money is poured into a service that is both economically and environmentally unsustainable,"" according to Kirsty Williams, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats. She wants the money spent on improving rail transport in Wales.
 However, Ieuan Wyn Jones, the leader of the Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru and the Assembly member for Anglesey, said that the service was an ""essential link"".  He hoped that the company would be able to keep going, or in a ""worse case scenario"", that the route would be run by administrators while the Assembly Government looked at other options.
 The company has carried 37,000 people on its twice-daily service since it started operating.  According to Jones, this showed that that the service ""has been a huge success with passenger numbers far exceeding expectations"".  
 Bidding for the next contract with the Assembly Government to provide the route closed last week, with Highland Airways thought to be the only entrant.  The lack of other bids was ""particularly worrying"", commented Jenny Randerson, Welsh Liberal Democrats transport spokesperson.  ""This does suggest that despite huge public subsidy, this service is still not seen as a viable, profitable, and green solution to this key transport need"", she said.
 Highland Airways is based in Inverness, Scotland, where it operates passenger and freight services for island communities. The news that the company was in difficulty was said to come as a surprise to business and transport leaders in Scotland, where it is regarded as a ""Highland success story"".

"," Workers at the Linamar automobile parts factory in Swansea, Wales voted by a wide margin today to strike, after an dispute over the firing of one of the worker's union organisers remained unresolved.
 An 88% turnout resulted in a vote of 139 in favor of striking to 19 against.
 Canada-based Linamar took over the plant from Visteon in July 2008. Shortly after the takeover, Linamar offered 208 of the plant's 360 workers voluntary redundancy, hoping to transfer work to Mexico; 140 accepted. Linamar claims to have no long-term plans to close the plant. On April 28, however, Linamar fired political activist and union convener Rob Williams. Upon Williams' firing, he refused to leave the Visteon plant. The police escorted him from the building as the day shift workers at the plant staged a spontaneous walkout. Williams was temporarily reinstated after emergency negotiations between Unite and Visteon management, but his dismissal was made permanent a week later.
 Unite, Williams's trade union, describe Williams's firing as an ""illegal"" ""attack on the union"" and has brought the matter to the attention of UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Williams himself told left-wing newspaper Socialist Worker: ""They have sacked me because they want to weaken the union and intimidate the shop floor.""
 Workers at the plant also say Linamar is breaking a promise made to the union when the plant was taken over to keep Visteon's terms and conditions, particularly to establish a final pension scheme for workers who were part of the company before its 2000 spin-off from Ford.
 Linamar has not given comment to the press on the dispute as of this writing.
 Rallies in support of Williams, who is also running for European Parliament on the No2EU ticket, and of the union have drawn sizeable crowds, with about 90 at the most recent rally include three Members of the Welsh Assembly representing the ruling coalition of the Labour Party and Plaid Cymru as well as the Liberal Democrats, on May 17 outside the Visteon plant in Swansea.
 Linamar Swansea has close ties with Visteon factories in Enfield, Belfast and Basildon. Workers at those three factories recently won a victory against Visteon by occupying their plants and locking management out when redundancies were announced in April.

Eight people, including three Canadian citizens, were charged in Brooklyn, New York yesterday with various offences. At the same time the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrested a 26-year-old in Ontario in relation to the plot. He faces extradition to the United States. 
 Charges against the nine include fundraising and money laundering through US bank accounts and charitable organizations for the Liberation Tigers of Talim Eelam, or Tamil Tigers, who have been fighting the Sri Lankan military in a civil war since 1983.
 Two of the men allegedly tried to bribe undercover US State Department officials with $1 million in order to remove the Tigers from the official list of terrorist organizations which bars the group from raising money, obtaining weapons or lobbying. A more extensive investigation ensued involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Joint Terrorism Task Force. 
 The RCMP was brought in when the FBI learned of a Canadian allegedly being involved. Ultimately, the three Canadians arrested in the United States are accused of travelling to New York to purchase the military equipment including 50 to 100 SAM missiles, assault rifles, truck mounted missiles, aerial vehicles for jamming radio transmissions and radar, submarine design software as well as flight lessons and military training.

"," Sri Lanka government forces repulsed an overnight offensive by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the northern Jaffna peninsula in some of the fiercest fighting since the 2002 truce.
 The LTTE attempted an amphibious attack arriving in a flotilla of gunboats. Government troops drove them off, supported by artillery and aerial bombing.
 According to a military spokesperson, Major Rajapakse, the army killed at least 98 Tamil Tigers and wounded twice as many. The army suffered 6 killed and 60 wounded.
 ""The situation has calmed down now after heavy fighting till early this morning,"" Rajapakse said.
 The ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka is an ongoing conflict between the Government of Sri Lanka and the ethnic Sri Lankan Tamils on the island-nation of Sri Lanka. Since the 1983 ""Black July"" pogrom, there has been on-and-off civil war, mostly between the government and the LTTE who want to create an independent state of called Tamil Eelam in the north and east of the island. It is estimated that the war has left 65,000 people dead since 1983 and caused great harm to the population and economy of the country. A cease-fire was declared in 2002, but hostilities renewed in late 2005 following military operations against Tiger-controlled territory in the east.

"," Protesters against police violence marched Saturday, May 23, from Trafalgar Square to New Scotland Yard in central London. The protest, organized by the United Campaign Against Police Violence (UCAPV) and with the support of several UK trade unions and activist groups, including from the 6th largest UK trade union; the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS).
 Protesters marched against police violence in the UK, including as perpetrated by riot police against activist activities and by other police towards members of black and ethnic minority communities. The protest also called for an end to containment of protesters by police on demonstrations, a controversial tactic known as ""Kettling"" and for freedom to protest without intervention by police.
 The march began in Trafalgar Square, central London, where police and private security attempted to move the rallying protesters, but did not succeed. Protesters marched on towards New Scotland Yard; the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Service, passing Downing Street and Parliament in the Palace of Westminster, encountering minor police resistance and cheering Tamil Tigers protesters in Parliament Square as they marched past.
 Slogans chanted throughout the march included ""No Justice; No Peace"" and calls for the dissolving of the police Territorial Support Group (TSG), who have allegedly perpetrated acts of serious violence against protesters; a large proportion of the  allegations of brutality during the G20 summit protests accuse the TSG. Among these calls were questions of 'How many skulls have you cracked today' and call-and-response of 'Hey Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, The TSG Has Got to Go'.
 The procession was accompanied by several police vans, officers on foot and Forward Intelligence Team (FIT) members. Policing of the event was mostly provided by CO11, the Metropolitan Police public order unit. 
 The protest crossed an SOCPA zone without police permission. Because of the illegality of the protest, it was not facilitated by police. Due to this, the police did not assist with traffic flow or close roads, including the road outside the main entrance to New Scotland Yard where the end rally was held.
 The protest ended at the New Scotland Yard building, where activists gradually tried to surround the building by linking arms and hands, although did not succeed in fully encircling it. The attempted ""kettling"" of the building was followed by speeches from people affected by police violence, including member of the United Friends and Families Campaign, Doreen Bishop, mother of Ricky Bishop who died in police custody in 2001. Also speaking was Sam Rigg-David, representing the Sean Rigg Justice & Change Campaign; Chris Nineham from the Stop The War Coalition; Martin Smith from the Socialist Workers Party and political rap performer/poet Lowkey and many other representatives from campaign groups and those representing affected families and groups.
 As speeches ended, protesters held an open mic in the road next to the entrance to the scotland yard building. The road had not been closed and police had allowed traffic to attempt to continue along the road. However towards the end of the rally, protesters blocked 2 coaches from attempting to traverse the road by blocking the roadway, some sitting on the ground.
 Three protesters were arrested during the event. Wikinews learned from an anonymous legal observer from the Legal Defence and Monitoring Group on 28 May that one man arrested was believed to have an outstanding warrant following an animal rights activism related offense. A woman, believed to be his girlfriend, was reported to have been arrested for pushing and swearing at police after the male was arrested, and was arrested under section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, for causing the police intentional harassment. The third, a man, was believed to have been arrested after allegedly urinating on the wall of the Scotland Yard building, in public view, and was arrested under either section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986, for causing the police intentional harassment or for indecent exposure under Section 66 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003; reports are unclear as to which.
 The three arrested were taking part in the surrounding of Scotland Yard, and were arrested by police on the side of the building away from the main speeches and people; protesters were not aware of this until towards the end. The three are believed to have been taken to Charing Cross police station.
 According to the United Campaign against Police Violence; the protest organizers, they will be continuing to protest on this issue, the next protest being on July 10th 2009 outside the office of the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
Furthermore, according to information released by the UCAPV; the University and College Union (UCU), representing lecturers, has officially affiliated to the campaign nationally.

"," The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and other agencies have raised the issue of a humanitarian crisis unfolding in the battle between Sri Lankan government troops and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), with an estimated 250,000 civilians caught between the fighting according to the ICRC.
 Violence has intensified over the past few days in the Tamil-dominated northwest, where government forces have made strategically important gains, including the capture of Mullaitivu, the last rebel stronghold. But hundreds of thousands of civilians, nearly all Tamils, remain trapped within a 300 square kilometer war zone.
 The ICRC, the only aid agency with a permanent presence in the war zone, says 250,000 people are trapped in the fighting, a figure that was repeated by the United Nations. The ICRC also claims that hundreds of civilians in the area have been killed or wounded, though an exact number was not given.
 Sri Lankan officials say these figures are too high, though they have acknowledged the existence of some civilian casualties. In an effort to help civilians seek shelter, the government has unilaterally established a 32-square-km ""no-fire zone"" in the middle of the war area. The army dropped pamphlets urging civilians to go there for safety.
 However, the LTTE have accused the Sri Lankan military of firing artillery shells into the safe zone, while the government denies such accusations. Likewise, the LTTE have denied the claim that they are using civilians as human shields by forcing them to stay in the area while holding them at gunpoint. The LTTE have yet to answer the military's accusation that they deliberately placed their heavy weapons near populated areas and hospitals.
 In response to accusations of firing at civilians, President Mahinda Rajapaksa pledged that his military would respect the boundaries of the no-fire zone. In a late-night meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee, the president assured his forces would ""minimize the effects of conflict on Tamil civilians."" Mukherjee has pledged to send aid materials into northern Sri Lanka. However, some Indian media sources suspect this is a political move aimed at gaining favor with the DMK, a Tamil party in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
 Meanwhile, the fate of civilians in the war zone remains uncertain, as the violence has prevented most foreign media and international agencies from entering the area. The ICRC has called on both sides to respect the lives of civilians. ""People are being caught in the crossfire, hospitals and ambulances have been hit by shelling and several aid workers were injured while evacuating the wounded,"" said Jacques de Maio, the head of operations for the ICRC in South Asia.
 The ICRC says hundreds of patients are in need of emergency medical treatment. However, the UN says the LTTE have fired at their convoys and refused to allow evacuations to the nearest hospital, while the military had resumed firing during an attempted evacuation. The UN condemned this as a violation of international humanitarian law, which requires a guarantee of safe passage for aid workers on both sides. 
 ""It's an incredibly serious situation,"" said James Elder, a U.N. spokesman. ""We have a very large number of people, including tens of thousands of children, trapped in a fast-shrinking conflict zone."" ICRC spokeswoman Sarasi Wijeratne did not explicitly accuse the LTTE of firing on their convoy, simply stating that the convoy had not been given full security assurances.
 Sri Lankan military officials say the rebels are nearly defeated, with only about 30 kilometers of seafront remaining under their control. Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara claims the LTTE have 1,200 well-trained cadres left, while the Sri Lankan army has around 50,000 troops deployed.

"," President Mahinda Rajapaksa called on Tamil rebels (LTTE) to surrender to end the quarter-century of civil war and their struggle for a separate homeland amid the capture of Iranamadu junction, town of Paranthan. He claimed that the recapture of Kilinochchi on Friday is a unparalleled victory against terrorism and separatism. ""The time is not far off when people of the north can breathe freedom again, we should pay the gratitude of the whole nation to those heroic soldiers who achieved that victory,"" Rajapaksa said. The President further appealed for the release of civilians in Vanni.
 The downfall and liberation of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam' mini-state, de facto and administrative capital Killinochchi is a fatal blow to the rebels' 25-year struggle to create an independent state for the Tamils, an ethnic group native to Tamil Nadu, a state in India, and the north-eastern region of Sri Lanka. They predominantly speak Tamil, with a recorded history going back two millennia.
 In November 2008, the Sri Lankan Army launched an attack on Kilinochchi from three directions. LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran said he promised to defend his stronghold by reverting to guerrilla-style, hit-and-run attacks. ""No sane voice is being raised either to abandon war or to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict,"" Prabhakaran said.
 The Battle of Kilinochchi lasted between November 2008 and January 2009 as part of the SLA Northern offensive when the Sri Lanka Army assaulted the Tamil Tiger capital and stronghold. The military announced on Friday it had gained control of the town as the rebels moved towards Mullaitivu, a small town on the north-eastern coast of Sri Lanka, and the capital of the district with the same name in the Northern Province of Sri Lanka. The rebels struggled since 1983 to establish an independent nation for the Tamils. The conflict resulted in more than 70,000 deaths.
 Meanwhile, a suspected suicide attack near the Sri Lanka Air Force headquarters in Colombo killed two airmen and a member of the bomb-disposal unit, and wounded 37 others, three of them critically, just an hour after the President delivered his speech. According to air force spokesman Wing Commander Janaka Nanayakkara, the 37 injured were 16 airmen. 
 Sri Lankan Army's air force jets and Mi-24 helicopter gunships bombed rebel targets near Oddusuddan and Mullaitivu towns Saturday, when the military closed into the rebels' military headquarters. Government soldiers troops also advanced further to recapture the Elephant Pass which was seized by the Tamil Tigers in April 2000, killing hundreds of soldiers. The strategic Pass, at the Northern Province is located at the entrance to the Jaffna Peninsula which military wrested from rebel dominion in 1995. The rebels however claimed that ""the Sri Lanka army has entered a virtual ghost town as the whole civilian infrastructure as well as the centre of the LTTE had shifted further northeast."" Troops of the 59 Division attacked the LTTE's coastal garrison, south of Mullaittivu, where the battle had already begun. The siege reportedly killed over two dozen Tamil rebels. 
 Using the strategic crossroads of Paranthan Junction, the Sri Lankan Army's forces advanced Sunday in hot pursuit  to capture the Tamil Tigers' last strongholds. It launched both ground and air assault on Elephant Pass to the north and Mullaittivu to the east. ""Day by day, the Tigers' territory is shrinking and their numbers are dwindling. The objective of finishing this war won't be that long off,"" said Maj. Gen. Jagath Dias.
 Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian Chandrakanthan Chandraneru of Tamil United Liberation Front, called on the Sri Lankan government to bring in a political solution, since the war will continue despite the capture, unless the ethnic crisis is solved. “Everybody is now saying that the east is currently an open prison where people can neither walk nor talk freely. Same thing will happen to Tamil people in the north,” he added.
 Mano Ganesan, MP, leader of the Western People's Front (former WPPF) declared that ""political solution to the national ethnic question after the total military victory is not acceptable to the Tamil people. This contention would not convince the international community too. This is the hard truth."" 
 State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid asked the Sri Lankan government to respond to the Tamil concerns. The Tamil Tigers had been ""one of the most notorious and brutal terrorist organizations over the past 20 years,"" and ""a peaceful dialogue is what is called for to resolve the differences and legitimate concerns of the Tamils,"" he said.

"," Suspected Tamil Tiger rebels have ambushed and killed three soldiers in Sri Lanka's volatile eastern region, as a Norwegian peace broker flew in to the country in a last-ditch peace bid.
 The patrol was ambushed with a fragmentation mine - the most recent in a series of attacks which have killed over 70 military personnel since December.
 The attack came after Norwegian peace envoy Erik Solheim arrived in Sri Lanka for truce talks. As he arrived, three soldiers were killed in a landmine explosion in the east, which the army blamed on the Tamil Tigers. Rohan Abeywardene, deputy inspector general of police said the Tamil Tigers were responsible for the attack.
 The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have threatened to resume their armed struggle this year unless President Mahinda Rajapakse grants independence - which he has refused to do. The Tamil Tigers want a separate state in the north and east of Sri Lanka.
 The rebels have fought the government since 1983 to create a separate homeland for ethnic minority Tamils, accusing the majority Sinhalese-dominated state of discrimination.
 The rebels say they are ready to use suicide bombers, as in the past, if war resumes. The Sri Lankan army is preparing for the worst with analysts say both sides are already engaged in an undeclared war. The Tigers, accuse the military and government-backed paramilitaries of a litany of abuses, including rape and executions of Tamil civilians and rebels.
 About 65,000 people were killed in the conflict before the cease-fire. Peace talks broke down in April 2003, when the Tigers withdrew, demanding autonomy in the Tamil-majority northeast region.
 Over 100 people have been killed in the escalating violence since December.

 ""We captured the main Sampur artillery position of the Tigers, We suspect they dismantled the guns or pulled them back. We are now in Sampur."" said Keheliya Rambukwella.  Rambukwella noted that the government's troops received little or no resistance as they took the 10-km swath of land.  
 Overnight shelling and mortar attacks from the Tamil Tigers, the main rebel group involved in the fighting, killed one government soldier and injured several others.  The objective of the incursion, said Rambukwella, was to neutralize the use of three Tamil Tiger guns aimed on government troops to the south. Tamil Tigers are claiming that they have not fled the area, and are continuing to engage government troops.

"," Just days following the suicide attack of unarmed Sri Lankan naval officers in Habarana, another was launched in the early hours of the morning in the southern port city of Galle. Official reports stipulate that terrorists, under the guise of fishermen in 5 boats entered the harbor and detonated after ramming into gunboats anchored at the naval base. Initial reports confirm that at least 16 people were killed and scores of others were injured in the blast.
 The government has accused the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, LTTE, a militant separatist group, banned as a terrorist organisation in countries such as United States, England, India and Australia of conducting both attacks. Though the organization has not claimed responsibility for either, they are also yet to claim responsibility in a string of such attacks, including the assassination of the Indian Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, allegedly as retribution for ""war-crimes"" committed by the Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka.
 Analysts believe that the attack on the port city of Galle, a UNESCO heritage site and the heart of Sri Lanka's tourist industry was aimed at sparking a government response in the lead up to talks between the government and the LTTE, as well serving an economic blow in the lead up to peak tourist season on the island.
 The presence of envoys from the U.S., Japan and Norway are expected for this week's scheduled government talks with the LTTE.

"," ""Pakistan was un-affected by Talibans and al-Qaeda (in my opinion) until the US flushed them out of Afghanistan. So 9/11 and WTC and the post WTC attacks by the ISAF (read American, for the locals) forces have led to the present condition in NWFP. At least that is the way the people there see it,"" wrote Riaz A Hakeem in one of a series of email exchanges with Wikinews.
 Mr. Hakeem, 58, left the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) at the age of 25 and became a naturalized citizen of the U.S. Now a businessman who is active in Texas politics, he shares some views as a person who is in touch with his family and friends who remain in the region. He travelled throughout portions of Pakistan at the end of last year.
 What is the current situation in the NWFP?
 The Pashtun people are or were renowned for their hospitality. Many westerners commented on it. Some with suspicion NOT willing to believe some people so poor could be so generous. It was almost a character flaw. One could travel without fear of personal danger as long as you followed local protocols.
 That was the sort of mind set among the people. An ageless paradigm of self satisfaction: this is enshrined in the code of the Pashtuns way of life. 
 The Islamic radicalism is in reality nothing but the Taliban movement. Not all Pashtuns are Taliban (obviously), but most Taliban are Pashtun. Of these, most belong to the FATA. Of these, most were affected by their cousins from Afghanistan coming over. Mingled with them were Arab-Afghans, Uzbeks and some Tajiks and even Chechens. Some of these married within the tribes and formed a bond with the locals. Marriage bonds go back in history. 
 This Talibanization shows itself in the content of the Friday sermons at the mosque. Now it shows in the popularity of growing beards, especially since the MMA - the coalition of religious political party's - won power. More recently in their showdown with the Pakistan army in North and South Waziristan - where according to my sources, people prefer going to the Taliban for justice rather than the older system of Maliks and Political Agents. The latter are known as corrupt. In Pakistan, in general, people are sick of the amount of corruption. 
 Bannu, from where hails the Chief Minister of the NWFP, Mr. Durrani, is now in Taliban control in the sense that there is a parallel government that they have established which is functioning quite well and is popular among the people.
 Has Taliban influence caused a stricter intrepretation of Sharia law in the NWFP?
 Yes. The Maliks, or tribal elders, consider themselves quite conservatively religious. Even so, they had a laid back attitude towards enforcement of religious doctrine. 
 The Taliban emulated the Saudi system of having a department concerned with citizens’ morals (even the name is the same: the department for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice) and this department has, as in Saudi Arabia, an enforcement police, called mutawwa'in, a morals law-enforcement agency. 
 Is there a shift from tribal elders to clerics, as the main interpreters of law?
 There has been a movement in that direction, but it has started a power struggle between the clerics who traditionally have been at the lowest strata of the social structure. Now when they have seen a bigger role for themselves, first from the Taliban in Afghanistan – but also the government of the MMA in the NWFP, who are nothing more than glorified clerics themselves, only a little smarter in exploiting religion politically. 
 The MMA is largely non-Pashtun, which is a source of discontent in that they stand in the way of Pashtun nationalism, such as it is, because it only rears its head when non-Pashtuns start to usurp power over what the Pashtun consider their turf.
 The deal made between Pakistan's central government and the North and South Waziristan provinces, where tribal leadership was given the pivotal role in dealing with militants, has been criticized as a failure. What caused this initiative to fail?
 First off, I don't agree with the premise of the question, that the ""deal"" is a ""failure"" - for the following reasons: 
 Is the Talibanization of Pakistan partly due to a perception of corruption among the system of Maliks and Political Agents?
 The corruption is in the ISI, the Pak army and the Pak system of Political Agents (PA) assigned to these tribal zones (FATA & PATA). 
 These PA have budgets that are much like the CIA in that they are a single line item in the national budget, there is no accountability of where or how the PA spends the money. If one followed the IRS rules and looked at the lifestyles of the PA and compared them with their income, you would soon understand what was going on. 
 Musharraf critics are a larger issue. Republicans have coddled Pakistan with the belief that ""as long as they are pro America"" then democracy in Pakistan will come in due course. Democrats have, I think, insisted Democracy first, and then we can discuss the other issues later.
 The Talibanization of Pakistan has more to do with graduates of ""Raiwind"", a place near Lahore, where the ""Tablighi Jamaat"" conducts brainwashing camps. It was graduates of this place, in my opinion, that are responsible for Britain's 7/7 attacks as an example.
 Corruption amongst the Maliks is self limiting because of the egalitarian society they live in and because of Pashtunwali.  
 What is your view on Musharraf suspending judge Iftikhar Chaudhry?
 I believe, and this is widely held belief, that Musharraf has no constituency of his own for his power base. He wanted legitimization from the Supreme Court, and Mr Choudhry as Chief Justice (their system is not like ours) would not give it. 
 So Musharraf has had to hang on to his Army Chief of Staff position to get his power from the Army. If some one else were Chief of Staff, that person could refuse to support Musharraf.
 The Justice favorable to the general is Justice Iqbal, who was not the next in line for Chief Justice. The next in line is a Hindu. That presented problems of its own for Musharraf. So when the Hindu judge went for a trip to India, Iqbal became the ""available"" senior most Supreme Court judge, and hence the haste and lack of decorum with which Justice Chaudhry was removed.
 What is the prevailing sentiment regarding Pakistani government efforts in the provinces and the international effort in Afghanistan to combat Taliban and affiliated militants?
 In my dealings and inquires, one thing stood out like a sore thumb - the conspiracy theories vis-à-vis anything having to do with America. I mentioned to one of my close friends that events that were previously ascribed as acts of God were now considered acts of the CIA. Some even believed that the Earthquake in the northern areas was because of some sort of underground secret ""bomb"" used by the CIA. Lack of evidence is further proof that the CIA did it. I was flabbergasted, and started to give this kind of thinking as an example in speaking to ""educated"" Pakistani's - and among these, those that did agree that the earthquake was NOT the work of the CIA, they would start giving other examples, notably the Blow up of the plane carrying Zia ul Haq an ex President of Pakistan, in which the US Ambassador also perished. When I would point this out, the response would be that that is the sort of thing they do to take away suspicion from themselves.
 In a nutshell, the impression I came away with is, there is NO war of civilizations going on. What is going on is a war between literacy and illiteracy.
 Taliban are not visible in the areas I visited, but the militants handiwork clearly is - as elsewhere, the common criminals are taking advantage of this situation, and crime is up significantly. One new crime is Cell phone ""snatching"" - it's easy and nobody wants to pursue it. If some one is using a Razr phone, he can expect to be hit soon if he uses it in public. So people have two cell phones, one fancy to show off, and one for use in public places. 
 Insofar as ""foreign"" militants are captured and identified, that is to say non-Pashtun (including non Afghan Pashtun or Pak Pashtun) - then the people are obviously in agreement with the government that these people don't belong here and need to go. 
 The problem is this: the foreigners are usually in the FATA and have been there since the Soviet war times. Many of them have taken local wives and now have a family. The local have accepted them into their family. Now for the Pak govt to ask them to kick them out, the locals are thinking what am I doing to my grandchildren's father, etc. Again the edicts of Pashtunwali also play a role.
 What is the relationship, if any, between the Taliban and Al Qaeda?
 Al Qaeda is mostly composed of Arabs, they do not trust any one else. While they might use others as couriers or in lowly position as servants, for second rate Al Qaeda officials, the Top guys ONLY deal with Arabs and are served by Arabs. 
 The Taliban are mostly Pashtun tribesmen. Mostly they are graduates of madrassa's. Mostly illiterate by any world standards. The better educated among them will know how to speak a few words of English, such as their Information minister. There might be one or two notable exceptions of which I am not aware. 
 However, while Al Qaeda does not trust the Taliban, the Taliban look up to Al Qaeda top leadership. We saw this situation in Iraq where initially Al Zarqawi had no direct link with Qaeda but was keen to form one. It would be conjecture on my part to state that in the end he did indeed succeed in forming that connection. In the press at least that impression was prevalent.
 So the lines of interest proceed ONE way, like one way traffic. Extremist want to be affiliated with Qaeda, in my opinion, while the latter does not, so as to maintain its hideout. 
 The Qaeda supply lines are hampered, new recruits would have to be Arabs, and they would have to travel a long way through tight Pakistani security to reach here, or suffer hardship over a long and arduous land route through Balochistan and the Tribal area's - NOT all of which are accommodating. 
 So as is becoming clear, Qaeda is having trouble replacing people they loose meaning those that were captured or died. They only trust Arabs, and that also a certain type of Arabs, (not all Arabs are the same, not all Arabic is the same - for example they would never trust a Syrian, in fact Qaeda folks consider Syrian brand of Islam an apostasy - but that is another story). 
 Whatever remains of the Qaeda, are not in a position to set up training camps, since they are in a survival mode. The Taliban resurgence helps them get a little warm and fuzzy in this survival mode, since they feel a little bit more secure with their partners-in-arms doing some evil stuff, blowing up people and causing mayhem.
 What makes the North-West Frontier Province competent to administer money sent as foreign aid?
 This is the central question. Much like California has taken a separate initiative on stem cell research – as an analogy – the NWFP is central to the war on terror, not Pakistan. 
 The NWFP was central to the fight and aid to the Afghans during the Soviet occupation, not Pakistan. 
 This small distinction is lost on Washington, and it is the main reason, in my opinion, why so much of the Aid was ""lost in transit"" was because the Punjabi army officers could not bring themselves to dispense such large sums to an ethnic group which it considers anti-Pakistani. 
 All the FATA is contiguous to the NWFP.  The Taliban and Al-Qaeda are holed up somewhere either in the FATA, or across the Durand Line in Afghanistan; the Durand Line has never been recognized by the locals as an international boundary. Even today, the Pashtun travel from Peshawar to Kabul by road with out a passport or visa, and it has been like that for eons.
 The present governor of the NWFP belongs to the Orakzai tribe (he spells his name Aorakzai) and it is my opinion that that he was picked partly because he belongs to one of the FATA as well as he is a retired General of the Pak Army. 
 The Frontier Constabulary (FC) is a force which primarily recruits from the FATA. All or most of its forces are from the various tribes. In the eyes of the tribes this is a bona fide force and service with the FC is considered an honorable thing. The US has already allocated some funds for increasing recruitment, but far less than what it would take to counter the Taliban and far less than what the economic need is. The US spends a thousand times more on a battalions sent to monitor activity over there. Plus why endanger the lives of our troops and spread our forces thin when a more effective job can be done by the FC. The FC has over history shown that they will attack and use force against the tribes that create trouble. There have been no instances of insubordination or mutiny.
 Even the US Embassy is protected by a contingent of the FC! That goes to show their trustworthiness and discipline.
 The ""tribal"" Pashtuns in the FATA are not educated or trained and hence not employable right now. I propose that we fund directly the Director of Emigrants, Mr. Azhar Arbab in Islamabad, to set up training facilities in Concrete laying, iron work, pipe work, welding etc, which would then qualify these tribesmen to obtain jobs in the Gulf. As such we would remove them from the scene altogether. They would not be available in the labor pool to the Taliban or anyone else. I might add here, that a number of these individuals have very high innate intelligence, which is one reason they make formidable foes. 
 Now the central reason why the NWFP ought to do this is because they are themselves most affected by the scourge of Talibanization. They are highly motivated in carrying out these policies because it is to their own benefit. 
 How many men does the FC field currently?
 The FC currently has about 23,000 men in total.
 How much do they get paid?
 They are paid the equivalent of $60 per month per person -Pak Rupees 3665, where Rs61= $1. 
They do have some fringe benefits but life is very spartan for these soldiers. 
 What the US could get in return is a huge bang for a buck, no pun intended. 
 I think we ought to double the number of these soldiers with one proviso that the FC maintains its high standards of recruits.
 Compare this with our costs in the War against Terror; just Halliburton’s bills will have you reeling. I think that it would be foolish, NOT to do this. 
 The Frontier Constabulary is an Institution with a long and glorious history within the Frontier Province.
 The recruits come strictly from the tribes of the various FATA and so they are very familiar with the people, the bad guys the terrain.
 They speak the Pashto dialect of the locals. The Pashto language has many dialects, and you can tell where someone is from based on which dialect he speaks. So if you do not speak the correct dialect, you are immediately identified as an outsider. This is one reason why these tribes are impossible to penetrate, there are other reasons as well, that are beyond the scope of the current discussion.
 How can the FC help prevent attacks like the suicide bombing attempt on Sherpao in Charsadda last weekend?
 In essence your question is how can anyone prevent a suicide attack? 
And frankly if I knew the answer to that I think the US military - and several other groups - would be knocking on my door. I think the Israeli Army has had the most experience with this sort of thing. The suicide bombing as a tactical weapon was invented by the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, and even today in terms of statistics they use it in far greater numbers.
 So to summarize neither the FC nor anyone else can prevent a suicide bombing. We could attempt to improve our intelligence to find out about an imminent attack, but so far these have not been very successful in Pakistan.
 In the Lal Masjid Case the government avoided a suicide killing by negotiating with those two Mullah brothers - but I don't know if that counts. But it does make for an interesting story. Both Washington, DC and Islamabad now have Madams threatening to publish the list of their clients unless they are given protection. Who would have thunk?
 Going back to your question: In my opinion what ought to be done is to make a Policy change, and address the issues that are producing these suicide bombers, that is the only way to stop this phenomenon. 
 In this part of the world this is relatively new because prior to 9/11, suicide bombing was unheard of. Moreover it is not the FC's job to provide security to the Minister of the Interior, that is the job of the Police force, because this Ministry is equivalent to the Department of Homeland Security.
 You don't expect Border patrol to provide body guard duty to the Secretary of the department of Homeland Security.
 I am making these analogies so the American readers would relate to what is happening, and understand the difference in nomenclature. --RHakeem 20:13, 3 May 2007 (UTC)

"," Members of the Tamil community in Oslo, Norway are demonstrating in protest of the Sinhalese-dominated government of Sri Lanka. The protests are taking place peacefully on the grounds in front of the Storting, the Norwegian Parliament.
 The demonstrators are supporters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), popularly known as the Tamil Tigers. They criticised the Sri Lankan governments handling of Tamil civilians in the war zone in northern Sri Lanka and are attempting to get the Norwegian government to intervene diplomatically in the conflict to stop the Sri Lankan government from putting civilians at risk.
 The peaceful demonstrations come the day after Tamil protesters stormed the Sri Lankan embassy in Oslo. In response, this morning the Sri Lankan government refused to let Norway continue its mediating role in the decades-long Sri Lankan Civil War; the Norwegian government, in response, has said its role in bringing the two sides to the table ended in 2006. The protest leaders have apologized for the invasion of the embassy.
 The Norwegian government has given the demonstrators permission to demonstrate until Friday, but they are forbidden from staying all day or from camping on the Storting grounds.
 Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared a two-day cease-fire in government operations against the LTTE, the largest group fighting against the government, on Monday for the Sri Lankan New Year, to allow civilians to leave the combat zone. Tens of thousands of civilians, many displaced by the war, are in the combat zone.
 The LTTE has been campaigning violently for an independent homeland for the Tamil people in northern Sri Lanka since 1976. The Sri Lankan government has recently enjoyed a string of military successes against the LTTE, who have been driven out of all major towns they once controlled. The Sri Lankan government has stated it believes that there are now only 500 LTTE fighters remaining, intermingled with civilians in the Jaffna Peninsula.

"," 13 sailors have been reported killed and others missing or injured after suspected Tamil Tiger guerrillas attacked a naval vessel off northeastern Sri Lanka early Saturday. Sri Lankan military say it was one of the worst attacks by the sea Tigers of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
 According to defence officials, the Sri Lankan Navy fast attack craft was sunk in the early hours of Saturday by a heavy explosion carried out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels.
The Sri Lankan sailors were on patrol when a boat rigged with explosives rammed their vessel off the port of Trincomalee. 
 Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) said two of the injured sailors had been recovered, who were believed to have been thrown out by the power of the explosion.
 The LTTE has stepped up attacks against security forces in northern and eastern Sri Lanka since President Mahinda Rajapakse was elected on November 17th and invited the rebels to renew negotiations with the government.
 With Saturday's blast, over 65 security personnel and police officers have been killed in rebel attacks since the election.
 The attack follows LTTE reports of army abuses and killings. The government is investigating one such incident after five Tamil youths, whom the army said were blown up by their own grenade, were found shot dead.
 The Tigers say they want a political solution to the conflict, which has killed more than 64,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands since 1983. 
 A similar attack on the navy in Trincomalee harbour killed 12 sailors and led to the collapse of a previous ceasefire in 1995. 
 In December, 39 military personnel were killed in a string of mine attacks, the deadliest month since a 2002 ceasefire that some say is strained to breaking point.

"," The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, otherwise known as the Tamil Tigers, have told the BBC that they are prepared to fight back against Sri Lankan forces.
 The vow follows reports that Sri Lankan forces are laying siege to the last rebel-held areas of the island. The Sri Lankan army have said that the ""final battle"" was underway and predicted that the Tamil rebellion is finished. There have been rumours that Velupillai Prabhakaran, the Tigers' leader since the conflict began, had fled in the face of the assault. But political leader B Nadesan denied this, telling the BBC that the claim was ""malicious propaganda"".
 According to Reuters, analysts say that around 2,000 Tiger fighters remain in the face of the 50,000-strong government push into the north, which began in August 2006. Government forces captured Mullaitivu, the last stronghold of the Tigers, on Sunday. The Associated Press says that Tigers have been preventing civilians from leaving the war zone, with the government accusing them of using civilians as human shields. In turn, the government has declared a section of the territory to be a safe area for civilians but there have been reports of artillery fire and the United Nations say troops have been fighting in the area.
 Lt Gen Sarath Fonseka of the Sri Lankan army was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying ""the end of terrorism is near and we will definitely win"". Meanwhile aid agencies say 230,000 Tamil refugees are in the remaining battle zone. The Associated Press say that the area is densely populated and diplomats have expressed concern about the use of ground troops in the area. Most journalists are forbidden from entering the war zone, making confirmation difficult.
 Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa won the 2005 election on a hard-line ticket, ruling out autonomy for the Tamil north and east. This led to an increase in the war and the eventual abandonment of a Norwegian-mediated ceasefire at the start of last year.

"," French newspaper Le Monde published on Friday an article accusing the United Nations (UN) of deliberately hiding facts about civilian killings during the last months of the civil war in Sri Lanka in order to protect their own activities in the country.
 According to investigative journalism by Le Monde, The UN did not publish the number of civilians killed until it was finally leaked. According to a UN confidential report, 7,720 people were killed (among them 678 children) and 18,465 were injured (among them 2,384 children) between January 20 and May 13. A UN official declared to Le Monde that his hierarchy tried to suppress these figures to remain in good terms with the government. When these numbers were leaked, Neil Buhne, the UN official coordinator in Sri Lanka, asked to be the only recipient of the figures in the future. Even the secretary general Ban Ki-moon tried to hide the numbers, according to Le Monde.
 Despite the heavy bombings in the last days of the war, the 7,720 dead people are still given as an official figure which was repeated in The New York Times. According to Vijay K. Nambiar, Ban Ki-moon's chief-of-staff cited by Le Monde, the numbers could be closer to 20,000; these figures are corroborated by The Times. The paper discovered compelling evidence showing that on average 1,000 Sri Lankan civilians perished each day during the first 19 days of May. ""These figures are not even complete yet. It’s going to end up way more"" said a UN source.
 The Times relied on aerial photographs, confidential UN documents, witnesses and independent defense experts to understand the final days in the 26 year old Sri Lankan civil war. 200,000 survivors are interned in the Manik Farm refugee camp. The camp was visited twice by The Times investigators. 3,000 wounded civilians are still missing from the last known makeshift hospital. A survivor reported hospitals were bombed by the government which claimed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels were using them as hideouts. “They didn’t want anyone left to say what had happened,” say UN sources. 
 “We reject all these allegations. Civilians have not been killed by government shelling at all. If civilians have been killed, then that is because of the actions of the LTTE [rebels] who were shooting and killing people when they tried to escape.” said a representative for the Sri Lankan High Commission. Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara of Sri Lanka added ""We have not used any shelling or mortaring, only small arms. We know how we are fighting"". The aerial images taken by The Times suggest the contrary.
 Le Monde also wrote that the United Nations did not help its people on the ground. Text messages sent by local employees in the war zones asked to ""stop the war"" and ""what is the international community doing"". ""Hundreds of people trying to flew where caught by local dictators and beaten, without distinction of age and sex. I hear them crying."" said another one. In April, Vijay Nambiar asked the locals to keep a ""low profile"" and play an active role in supporting the government.
 The Sri Lankan government denied any wrongdoing. On Wednesday, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland cleared Sri Lanka of any alleged war crimes. Sri Lanka gained the support of China, Egypt, India and Cuba.

 Barr officially entered the race on May 12, two weeks before the convention amidst months of speculation. He won the nomination on the sixth ballot of the convention edging Mary Ruwart 324–276. Wayne Allyn Root was nominated as his running mate after losing on the fifth ballot and throwing his support to Barr. 
 Barr's main opposition in the Libertarian race highlighted his vote in Congress in favor of the USA PATRIOT Act in 2001 following the September 11 attacks. He has since renounced the vote, and has worked to repeal the act. Barr's candidacy was also seen by Libertarian ""radicals"" as an attempt by conservatives to take over the party.
 Following his nomination Barr remarked that he ""will not let [the Libertarian Party] down"" and that it ""will be a historic and positive campaign that will succeed."" To detractors who say he will take votes away from Republican candidate John McCain, Barr stated that ""If Senator McCain ... does not succeed in winning the presidency ... it will be because Senator McCain did not present, and his party did not present, a vision, an agenda, a platform and a series of programs that actually resonated positively with the American people."" Party spokesman Andrew Davis described the situation among the electorate as ""want[ing] and need[ing] another choice"" and stating that ""that choice is Bob Barr.""
 Barr's nomination made former Alaskan senator Mike Gravel — who recently switched from being a Democratic candidate to a Libertarian candidate for President back on March 25, 2008 — announce he is ending his political career.
 Gravel said, ""I just ended my political career, from 15 years old to now, my political career is over, and it's no big deal. I'm a writer, I'm a lecturer, I'm going to push the issues of freedom and liberty. I'm going to push those issues until the day I die.""

"," Former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson received the 2012 presidential nomination of the U.S. Libertarian Party at Saturday's Libertarian National Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada. Judge James P. Gray of California was selected as his running mate.
 Johnson's association with the Libertarian Party stretches back to 1993, when he was a dues-paying-member for about a year. In 2000, the party recruited him to run as their presidential nominee, but he rejected the offer, saying, ""I'm a Republican, and I'm not going to run for President.""
 As a Republican, Johnson was elected and re-elected as governor of New Mexico in 1994 and 1998.  During his governorship, he vetoed over 750 bills, more than all other then-governors combined, and left the state with a $1 billion budget surplus. Since leaving office in 2003 due to term limits, he has advocated for marijuana legalization, climbed Mount Everest, and has entered into presidential politics. 
 During the 2008 Republican primaries, Johnson endorsed the candidacy of Congressman Ron Paul, the Libertarian Party's 1988 presidential nominee. In 2012, he chose to mount his own presidential campaign, seeking the Republican Party nomination on a platform of non-interventionism in foreign affairs and extensive cuts to the federal budget.  Though he participated in two early Republican debates, Johnson was barred from most due to low poll numbers. As a result, in December, he decided to end his Republican campaign and return to the Libertarian Party.    
 After months of campaigning, Johnson edged activist R. Lee Wrights on the first ballot with 70 percent of the 595 convention delegates. Wrights received only 25 percent. In contrast, former Congressman Bob Barr took six ballots to secure the 2008 nomination.
 Upon his victory, Johnson proclaimed, ""I am honored and I just want to pledge that no one will be disappointed. We’re going to grow the Libertarian Party."" He suggested the party nominate James P. Gray as his running mate, and they complied, choosing Gray as the vice presidential nominee. Gray is a jurist, who has served as a trial judge for Orange County, California since 1983. He ran for Congress as a Republican in 1998, and was the Libertarian Party's 2004 nominee for U.S. Senate in California. In his writings and media appearances, Gray has advocated against the War on Drugs. 
 In 2008, the Libertarian Party appeared on 45 state ballots with Barr winning 0.4 percent of the popular vote. A recent Public Policy Polling (PPP) survey shows Johnson with six percent national support in a matchup with President Barack Obama and the presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney. A PPP poll from December showed Johnson with 23 percent support in a three way race in New Mexico.

"," Former New Mexico governor and current Republican Party (GOP) presidential candidate Gary Johnson is reportedly considering a run for the Libertarian Party (LP) presidential nomination. Johnson feels ""abandoned by the Republican Party"", he told The Santa Fe New Mexican, due to his exclusion from nine of the eleven GOP debates and believes the LP would give him a fair shot at their nomination.
 Johnson espouses libertarian views including marijuana legalization and defense budget cuts, which often run afoul of the GOP mainstream. Earlier this month, after filing suit with the Federal Election Commission and Federal Communication Commission for his exclusion from the November 12 CBS debate, he chastised the GOP establishment for failing to support him. The GOP agreed with the debate's inclusion criteria, which turned back candidates with less than three percent support in the Real Clear Politics average and third quarter fundraising receipts below US$1 million. 
 Johnson raised a little under US$240,000 in the third quarter and lately has not even been included in polls. He did appear in an August CNN poll, in which he led former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Utah governor Jon Huntsman. Despite their standing, both Santorum and Huntsman have been invited to every debate.
 Johnson believes his exclusion was a ""boardroom decision"" to protect the GOP's ""status quo."" But Republican party attorney John R. Phillippe Jr. says that without a minimum standard, ""the debates would be utter chaos and unhelpful to Republican voters"".
 If Johnson decides to leave the GOP and seek the LP nomination, it would not be the first time a member of the Republican Party did so. In 2008, former Republican Congressman Bob Barr ran and was selected as the LP nominee. In the general election, he garnered 0.4 percent of the popular vote.
 For 2012, the LP has achieved ballot access in all 50 states, and currently has nine presidential candidates, including National Guard officer R.J. Harris and Libertarian activist R. Lee Wrights.

 One faction of the 17-member LNC, led by at-large representative Dr. Mary Ruwart — who lost the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination to Barr at the National Convention in May by only a few votes — is supporting a resolution to apologize to Paul.
 This is being countered by another faction led by Treasurer Aaron Starr, who favors a resolution to chastise Paul for not endorsing Bob Barr and “splitting the Freedom Movement.” The motion supported by Starr was made available online Tuesday night. It can be read in its entirety below.
 The Libertarian National Committee is disappointed to learn that you have recently urged those in the freedom movement to vote for the likes of Ralph Nader, Cynthia McKinney and Chuck Baldwin, none of whom truly grasp the meaning of Liberty.
 More than before, we remain committed to our nominees for President and Vice President, Bob Barr and Wayne Root.  We believe both of them boldly present the ideals of limited government, lower taxes, lower spending, and more freedom to the American people.
 We invite you to restore your commitment to Liberty by supporting the only candidates on the ballot this year who understand the Constitution and are prepared to restore our republic to what the Founders believed.
 Toward Liberty,
 The Libertarian National Committee

"," Reports published by various political news websites on Wednesday night said that there may be a movement within the Libertarian Party to replace its vice presidential nominee, Wayne Allyn Root.
 This comes after Libertarian National Committee (LNC) representative Stuart Flood made a motion to remove Root from the ballot over remarks that the latter made in a recent interview with Reason Magazine. Many found these remarks to be racially insensitive.
 It is reported that Libertarian presidential nominee and former congressman Bob Barr wants Root off of the ballot as well, which some believe is the reason that the Barr campaign supposedly advised party Chairman Bill Redpath to keep Angela Keaton, a probable vote for Root’s removal, on the LNC. Over the past few weeks, several members of the LNC have been trying to remove Keaton from the committee because of what they felt were sexually inappropriate comments written by her in a blog.
 Barr has been the subject of controversy for over a week because of his last-minute refusal to attend former Republican presidential hopeful Congressman Ron Paul's third party unity conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC last Wednesday.

 Less than five years ago, a Yale University grad student by the name of Jason Sorens wrote an essay for The Libertarian Enterprise, a libertarian news and commentary site published by science-fiction author L. Neil Smith. Frustrated by a lack of political clout, Sorens proposed that libertarians - people who are socially tolerant and fiscally conservative - could move to a single state and have a much greater impact.  Sorens received more than 200 messages in response, and the Free State Project was born.
 The strategy has matured since that announcement, but the core idea remains intact. In a state with a population of 1.3 million, 20,000 activists can break beyond the novelty value of American third-party viewpoints.
 As of this writing, over 7100 people have made that original pledge.  This year, spurred by the success of early movers, a second pledge was created.  Known as the ""First 1000"", this pledge has a strict timeline for success; 1000 people must agree, by the end of 2006, to move to New Hampshire by the end of 2008.  Like the original statement of intent, should the signers fall short of the goal, none of them are obligated to follow through. As of today, nearly 300 people have signed on to the First 1000.
 Most Free Staters, or ""Porcupines"" so named for the group's mascot, know each other only by way of communicating over the Internet.  Once per year, they shed their online monikers and meet in real life, at the annual Porcupine Freedom Festival, known affectionately as ""Porcfest"".
 Porcfest '05 brought an estimated 500 activists from around the country, including former Presidential candidate Michael Badnarik.  While the press attended the event, Free Staters used the festival as an opportunity to socialize and relax.

"," Libertarianz party president, Craig Milmine, and the party leader, Bernard Darnton, spoke exclusively to Wikinews journalist Gabriel Pollard about the political philosophy, libertarianism in New Zealand. This article follows on from interviews with republican, Lewis Holden; and monarchist, Noel Cox.
 The idea of libertarianism is where consent is required for all actions between people, and that these interactions are voluntary. Over four million people will be given freedom to run their own lives as Mr Milmine said. He says the Government doesn't follow this generally accepted principle. ""They take money without consent, order us around, and tell us what we can and cannot put in our bodies."" Their party website states, “We will put paid to bloated government bureaucracy and its authoritarian inclinations.”
 Mr Darnton said that one of the biggest jobs of Libertarianz is to show New Zealanders how their lives could be better. ""Most parties complain when others steal their policies. We just smile and get on with the next thing."" Libertarianz is, as Mr Milmine says, “principled opposition to the idea of a large nanny-state government in New Zealand.
 “A burglar stealing your TV is in the wrong because they are taking without permission. The government steals a proportion of your wealth every year, the fact that they allow a minor amount of input from you into how they are going to distribute the stolen loot does not change the fact that they stole it in the first place.”
 Mr Darnton also describes the current system of governance as a game. “What's right or wrong doesn't really matter as long as the red team or the blue team or whoever is scoring more points. I think that's a terrible way to approach government.""
 The reason this political philosophy, underpinned by objectivism, isn't well accepted in the New Zealand culture is because New Zealanders are generally wary of major change, vote for the party they always have, and vote for the party they think will win, not the one they want to win, Mr Darton believes. ""These sorts of behaviour reinforce the big parties, even though neither have much to offer,” Mr Darton said, “What Libertarianz is proposing is something quite different to anything any other party is putting forward.” Mr Milmine sees New Zealanders accepting libertarianism because, “Slowly people see that the government doesn’t solve their problems, it caused them in the first place.” And when this is followed by a significant minority, Mr Milmine says, the change will happen very quickly.
 Although Mr Milmine does say that he cannot predict what will happen to New Zealand if it were to change to a libertarianism state, ""because it is asking me to predict the interactions of over four million people when they are given freedom to run their own lives.""
 As well as changing the system of Government, Libertarianz also propose New Zealand becoming a republic and removing the constitutional monarchy. Mr Darnton said, “The monarchy is so distant in New Zealand that I don't think becoming a republic would make a big difference in many people's lives.” Mr Milmine says, “A head of state has a valid role to play as a check on the power on the government, but it cannot perform this role if it is toothless.”
 Although Mr Darnton believes that New Zealand will eventually become a republic, he is wary of making a push to it too quickly. He cites anti-prosperity and the governmental interference as issues that could make it into a written constitution and making it harder to shift later. While Mr Milmine says they would run into problems with people disagreeing with the Treaty of Waitangi if it were placed into a written constitution. But says a written constitution is needed, “There are examples of where [a written constitution] has worked and there are plenty of examples of the government ignoring the rights in our Bill of Rights because of the lack of a written constitution.”
 And the final question asked to both Craig Milmine and Bernard Darnton was whether they were a Holden or a Ford fan. Mr Milmine said he preferred “Subaru – I prefer the rallies – they allow more freedom” while Mr Darnton bluntly said, ""No, I'm not.""

"," The following is the first edition of a monthly series chronicling the 2020 United States presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories.
 This month's spotlight on the campaign trail includes interviews with the vice presidential nominees of the Constitution and Libertarian parties as well as the chosen running mate of the leading Green Party presidential candidate. 
 At the beginning of May, with the Coronavirus Pandemic ongoing and stay-at-home orders easing in some states, presumptive US Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden led incumbent US President Donald Trump of the Republican Party in the RealClearPolitics average of head-to-head opinion polls, 47.4 percent to 42.1 percent.  In an April 30 – May 4 Monmouth poll with then-US Libertarian Party presidential candidate Congressman Justin Amash included, Biden led Trump 47 percent to 40 percent with 5 percent for Amash. 
 Congressman Amash, who changed his party registration to Libertarian, contended for the Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, but dropped out of the race just ahead of the party's online National Convention. At the convention, the party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, Jo Jorgensen, won the presidential nomination.  Podcaster Spike Cohen received the vice presidential nomination.  In other third parties, at its own online national convention, the US Constitution Party nominated a ticket of businessman Don Blankenship for president and Michigan Taxpayers Party chairman William Mohr for vice president.  For the US Green Party, former Minnesota governor Jesse Ventura joined the party and had signaled an intent to run but ultimately decided against it.   Labor activist Howie Hawkins broadened his lead among pledged Green Party delegates, approaching the number required to secure the nomination at the online Green National Convention, scheduled for July 11. Hawkins, who is also the presidential nominee of the Socialist Party USA, had his hopes of a left-wing coalition dashed when it was reported the ballot-qualified Peace and Freedom Party of California and the Liberty Union Party of Vermont chose Party for Socialism and Liberation presidential nominee Gloria La Riva as their presidential nominee.   Hawkins selected 2016 Socialist Party USA vice presidential nominee Angela Walker to be his running mate.     
 Biden first addressed the allegations of sexual assault from former staffer Tara Reade, on television program Morning Joe.  When confronted with the accusation he penetrated Reade, against her will, using his fingers under her clothing in 1993, Biden told host Mika Brzezinski ""No, it is not true. I am saying unequivocally it never, never happened, and it didn't. It never happened.""  Meanwhile, a new allegation surfaced from a woman, a niece of Biden's 2008 US Senate opponent Christine O'Donnell, who claimed Biden commented on the size of her breasts when she was 14 years old.  The campaign called the statement ""absolutely false.""  An organizer said Biden was not at the event specified.  O'Donnell defended her niece's claim, saying it may have taken place at a different time. 
Biden searched for a female running mate. 2018 gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams of Georgia, Congresswoman Val Demings of Florida, Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer were mentioned as possibilities.  Biden said he planned to announce his choice around August 1.  Continuing a trend from earlier months, Biden made a couple of gaffes in May.  First, he juxtaposed numbers, claiming 85,000 Americans were unemployed and millions had died from coronavirus.  More consequential, he told African American radio host Charlamagne tha God ""if you have a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or Trump, then you ain’t black.""  Backlash from the statement led Biden to express ""I shouldn’t have been so cavalier [...]  No one should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background.""  In another incident, as Biden remarked on investigation, shortly before President Trump took office, of then-National Security Advisor-designee General Michael Flynn, Biden failed to mention his own request at the time to unmask Flynn's identity.  The unmasking came to light shortly thereafter in a release of documents related to alleged FISA abuse,  which President Trump described as ""Obamagate.""  An analysis of anti-Biden memes showed ""Dementia Joe"" as a popular characterization of Biden. 
 President Trump made several controversial statements in May.  Early in the month, he received additional fallout from a statement he made in late April about the use of disinfectant inside the body to treat coronavirus.  He hinted that the White House Coronavirus Task Force would be disbanded, but later reversed himself.  Nevertheless, the task force's daily press conferences did cease.  Trump said he himself took the drug hydroxychloroquine, which he promoted early in the pandemic as a counter-measure against coronavirus, despite reports about the side effects.  He tweeted support for the protests to end statewide shutdown orders despite it undermining his own guidelines.  He also promoted an unsubstantiated conspiracy theory suggesting Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough was involved in the death of a Congressional intern in 2001.  When Trump tweeted that state plans to use mail-in ballots to allow people to vote from home would result in voter fraud, Twitter placed a disclaimer ""fact checking"" the tweet.  In response, Trump issued an executive order making social media that exercises editorial control open to liability.  Twitter continued to edit Trump's tweets.  Trump tweeted about the riots that followed the death of George Floyd, an African American man who died in Minneapolis while a police officer restrained him.  Part of Trump's tweet included the statement, ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts.""  Twitter disallowed comments and likes and placed a warning over the tweet alerting viewers it promoted violence.  Trump later said he meant looting leads to somebody getting shot, perhaps by rioters.  The phrase itself has historic, racial overtones, of which Trump claimed to be unaware.  Meanwhile, Trump attended the joint NASA-Space X launch and delivered a speech to mark the occasion.
 By the end of the month, with coronavirus deaths surpassing 100,000  and protests and riots related to the death of Floyd spreading throughout the nation, Biden maintained his lead over Trump in the RealClearPolitics average of opinion polls, 48.4 percent to 42.5 percent. 
 At the Constitution Party's 2020 National Convention conducted online May 2, the party nominated businessman Don Blankenship for president on the second ballot.  For vice president, the party unanimously chose Michigan Taxpayers Party — the Constitution Party's affiliate in Michigan — chairman William Mohr. 
 While Blankenship has been widely covered for his role as CEO of Massey Energy during the 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster that resulted in the deaths of 29 miners, his subsequent conviction for misdemeanor conspiracy to violate safety standards willfully, his one year imprisonment, and his unsuccessful 2018 campaign for the Republican Party's US Senate nomination in West Virginia,  Mohr is relatively unknown. He was a candidate for Michigan House of Representatives in every election from 2006 to 2014.  He received 3 percent of the vote in his 2012 run and 2.3 percent in his 2014 run.
 In 2016, the Constitution Party ticket of Darrell Castle for president and Scott Bradley for vice president received 203,091 votes (0.15 percent)  with ballot access in 24 states.   For 2020 the party is currently on the ballot in 14 states. 
 With Wikinews, Mohr discussed how his nomination for vice president came about, his role on the Blankenship/Mohr ticket, and the prospects for the ticket.
 ((WSS))  How did your nomination for vice president come about? Did you seek the role or was it thrust upon you?
 ((WSS))  What are your thoughts on presidential nominee Don Blankenship? How do you complement him on the ticket?
 ((WSS))  With the coronavirus pandemic hampering ballot access efforts, is it possible to improve on the electoral performance of 2016 presidential nominee Darrell Castle?  What can you do to improve the visibility of the ticket?
 On May 23 at the online Libertarian National Convention, the Libertarian Party nominated Clemson University psychologist Jo Jorgensen, the party's 1996 vice presidential nominee, for president on the fourth ballot.  The next day, the party nominated podcast host Jeremy ""Spike"" Cohen for vice president on the third ballot.  Cohen, who went into the convention as the running mate of performance artist Vermin Supreme, was not the candidate Jorgensen initially backed for the vice presidential nomination.
 Cohen, who goes by his nickname ""Spike"", which he has explained derives from a character on ‘’My Little Pony’’, was initially a neoconservative but shifted to libertarianism.  In 2016, he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. He is co-owner of Muddied Waters Media, which features his podcast (((My Fellow Americans))).
 With Wikinews, Cohen discussed his journey from neoconservatism to libertarianism, his role on the Jorgensen-Cohen ticket, and how to improve on the performance of the party's 2016 ticket of former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson for president and former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld for vice president, which received 4,489,235 votes (3.27 percent).
 
((WSS))  What was it that turned you away from neoconservatism to begin your transition to libertarianism?
 ((WSS))  How would you describe your role as vice presidential nominee?  How do you complement Jo Jorgensen on the ticket?
 ((WSS))  How can you improve on the performance of Johnson-Weld in 2016?
 On May 5, US Green Party presidential frontrunner and the presidential nominee of Socialist Party USA, Howie Hawkins, announced his selection of a running mate for the 2020 presidential race.  Hawkins, a union leader and co-founder of the Green Party approaching securing the delegates required for the Green Party's presidential nomination, tapped Socialist Party USA's 2016 vice presidential nominee Angela Walker. 
 Walker, a truck driver who currently resides in South Carolina, first met Hawkins in 2014 while she was running for Sheriff of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin as an independent socialist and Hawkins was running for governor of New York for the Green Party.  Walker received 20 percent of the vote in her race  and Hawkins received five percent in his.   That showing was Hawkins' best in three successive runs for governor — 2010, 2014, 2018.  In 2016, Walker was Mimi Soltysik's running mate with Socialist Party USA.  The ticket received 2,705 votes.
 The Green Party, which received 1,457,226 votes (1.06 percent) with the 2016 ticket of Jill Stein for president and Ajamu Baraka for vice president, is to nominate its ticket officially at its online national convention July 11.
 Wikinews reached out to Walker to discuss how her past experience impacts the current race, why Hawkins/Walker is the best choice for leftists and socialists, and what goals she has for this campaign. 
 ((WSS))  How does your experience as a nominee for vice president in 2016 help in the current campaign? How is your role the same or different from 2016?
 
((WSS))  Why should leftists and socialists support Howie Hawkins over Gloria La Riva or the Bernie Sanders-backed candidate Joe Biden?
 
((WSS))  What are your goals for this campaign?

"," The following is the second in a monthly series chronicling the U.S. 2012 presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after a brief mention of some of the month's biggest stories.
 In this month's edition on the campaign trail: the campaign manager for a candidate already seeking two presidential nominations discusses the likelihood his candidate will run for the Reform Party's nomination; a lesser known candidates forum reveals an alternative fuel possibility and concludes in a dramatic fashion; and the newly nominated candidate for the Boston Tea Party talks with Wikinews.
 In December 2011, businessman Herman Cain ended his campaign for the Republican Party's presidential nomination amid allegations of sexual harassment and an extramarital affair. Hoping to appeal to social conservatives, Texas governor Rick Perry released a commercial in Iowa entitled ""Strong"", in which he states, ""there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school.""  While the video received 24,407 likes by the end of the month, it received 725,698 dislikes. 
 Frontrunner Newt Gingrich had trouble of his own after he suggested during an interview with The Jewish Channel that Palestinians were an ""invented people"". He refused to retract the comments at the final GOP debate before the January 3 Iowa Caucus. Gingrich's lead in the polls disappeared as Mitt Romney won big endorsements from South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, former Senator Bob Dole, and former president George H.W. Bush. 
 Meanwhile, Congressman Ron Paul rose in the polls as well, trailing Romney by two points in the final NBC/Marist poll of the year with Rick Santorum surging and Rick Perry close behind. However, Paul encountered his own troubles as the media reported on articles published in his newsletters from the 1980s and 1990s that included incendiary comments about blacks, gays, and Israel. Paul says he did not write the articles and has publicly disavowed them in the past. Additionally, Paul won the backing of Iowa State Senator Kent Sorenson, who previously served as the state chairman for Michele Bachmann, who continued to sag in the polls since winning the Ames Straw Poll in August. 
 Former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson, another candidate who had been low in the Republican polls, announced a switch to the Libertarian Party to run for that party's presidential nomination. Analysts have suggested that if Johnson wins the Libertarian nomination, he could possibly take votes away from the Republican nominee and help President Barack Obama win re-election.
 Presidential candidate Buddy Roemer addressed members of the Reform Party of New Jersey on December 10 at a joint Reform Party-Tea Party event.  The meeting raised speculation that Roemer, who is currently running for the presidential nominations of both the Republican Party and Americans Elect, would also seek the nomination of the Reform Party of the United States of America. 
 Dennis Mikolay, a member of the New Jersey party's leadership, wrote on his blog that ""there are efforts within the Reform Party to draft him [Roemer] as their candidate"".  However, Roemer, who served as Governor of Louisiana as a Republican, does not seem interested in the nomination. According to campaign manager Carlos Sierra, the Reform Party has ""reached out to us...but the Governor does not intend to seek their nomination. He is focused primarily on the GOP nomination. We think once his message gets a stage and an audience, that it will resonate with the Republican Party and Independents. The problem is he keeps getting shut out of the debates.""
 Industrialist Ross Perot founded the Reform Party in 1995. He won the party's presidential nomination the next year and received over eight percent of the popular vote, the highest percentage for a third party candidate since. After this, the party was plagued by infighting, and decreased in prominence. In 2008, Ted Weill was nominated for president, but appeared only on the ballot in Mississippi and received 481 votes. 
 For 2012, three candidates have announced their intentions to seek the party's nomination: former college football coach Robby Wells, Earth Intelligence Network CEO Robert David Steele, and small business owner Andre Barnett.

 On December 19, the New Hampshire Institute of Politics hosted a forum at St. Anselm College to present lesser-known candidates for the Republican and Democratic Party presidential nominations.  Wikinews covered the Democratic Party forum that showcased candidates challenging President Barack Obama for that party's presidential nomination, including anti-abortion activist Randall Terry and performance artist Vermin Supreme.
 A high point of the forum occurred after Vermin Supreme delivered his final statement. He exclaimed, ""Jesus told me to make Randall Terry gay"" and proceeded to glitter bomb Terry while shouting, ""he's turning gay.""  Terry had earlier affirmed his opposition to same-sex marriage, comparing it to slavery and abortion. Supreme later told Wikinews that Terry ""took his glittering like a man, a gay man. I don't know if the fairy dust turned him gay right away, but he took his medicine, and he seemed to enjoy it on some level."" Though Terry could not be reached for comment, he wrote on his blog that the glitter bombing ""appeared to have no impact on me becoming homosexual."" Supreme claims he was threatened by a Terry supporter after the forum and is now ""seeking Secret Service protection."" He has no plans to glitter bomb anyone else. 
 Supreme says that he had previously met Terry at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, and ""was given the distinct impression that he (Terry) wanted to perform fellatio on me.""  He says that prior to the forum, he offered ""to have 'homosexual gay sex' in the lavatory stall"", but Terry declined. During the forum, Supreme said that he planned to write-in Terry, but said afterwards that his support ""depends how gay he [Terry] gets."" 
 Dr. Bob Greene, a physicist who also participated in the forum, commented that the glitter bombing ""was inappropriate for the circumstances."" During the forum, Greene differentiated himself from his opponents by discussing the use of thorium as an alternative fuel, saying ""we have enough thorium for all of our energy needs for well over a thousand years."" He elaborated further after the forum, explaining that thorium could be used by bombarding it with neutrons, after which it fissions.  ""The fuel"", he explained, ""is a molten salt, really Thorium Fluoride with a couple of stable-izers."" Greene says that it is safer and produces less waste than conventional methods, but ""the military favored the uranium cycle because you could get lots of plutonium out of it, which they wanted for bombs.  Thorium - not so.""
 Others that participated in the Democratic forum include writer Ed Cowan, lawyer John Haywood, activist Edward O'Donnell Jr., and lawyer John Wolfe.
 On December 23, the Boston Tea Party (BTP) nominated Howard Community College trustee Tiffany Briscoe of Maryland as its second presidential nominee. The BTP was formed in 2006 and ""supports reducing the size, scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues, and opposes increasing the size, scope and power of government at any level, for any purpose."" In 2008, the party nominated boxing manager Charles Jay, who appeared on three state ballots and won a total of 2,422 votes.
 Briscoe's platform calls for the legalization of drugs, a repeal of the USA PATRIOT Act, and an end to subsidies and foreign aid. Former radio host Kimberly Johnson was selected as her running mate. 
 Briscoe took some time to speak with Wikinews about her campaign and the BTP.
 ((WSS)) How do you plan to gain ballot access for the BTP?
 ((WSS)) Ideologically, how are you different from Ron Paul or Gary Johnson?
 ((WSS)) What do you hope to accomplish with this campaign, and what would constitute a success?

535," Saturday, March 3, 2012 
"," The following is the fourth in a monthly series chronicling the U.S. 2012 presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after a brief mention of some of the month's biggest stories.
 In this month's edition on the campaign trail, the Libertarian Party holds a primary in Missouri, Wikinews interviews a lesser-known Republican candidate focused on the nuclear situation in Iran, and a Democratic candidate disputes a ""one-dimensional"" label.  
 In February 2012, three well-known figures announced third party runs.  Comedienne Roseanne Barr announced she would seek the Green Party's presidential nomination.  Former Congressman Virgil Goode opened a Constitution Party campaign. And former Louisiana governor Buddy Roemer proclaimed he would seek the Reform Party presidential nomination in addition to Americans Elect.
 Mitt Romney won the endorsement of businessman Donald Trump, and was victorious in the February 4 Nevada caucus. Three days later, Rick Santorum gained momentum with a sweep of three non-binding contests in Colorado, Minnesota, and Missouri. Though Romney gained a victory in the Maine caucus, Santorum's momentum pushed him ahead. He led the polls in Romney's former homestate of Michigan, shot to first place in national opinion polls, and won the endorsement of former Senator and current Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who retracted his support for Romney. Talk increased of someone else entering the GOP race if Romney lost Michigan.
 Santorum's rise and the Obama administration's new contraceptive mandate brought social issues to the forefront of the GOP race. The role of church and state gained prominence as Santorum remarked that hearing President John F. Kennedy's 1960 speech on separation of two, ""makes him throw up"". After a poor performance in the month's final GOP debate, Santorum began to fall in the Michigan polls.  However, members of the Democratic Party planned to vote for Santorum in the open primary, and Santorum ran robo-calls to Democrats asking for their support. In the end, Romney won in both Michigan and Arizona.
 Newt Gingrich, who largely skipped Michigan and Arizona, focused early on the Super Tuesday states, which hold their primaries in the first week of March. Ron Paul continued his run as well following a close second place finish in Maine. At the end of the month, rumors spread of a Paul-Romney alliance after an analysis of previous debates showed that Paul never attacked Romney directly, and after Paul's son Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said ""it would be an honor to be considered"" as Romney's running mate.  A spokesman for Ron Paul's campaign denied the rumors.
 In Missouri, the Libertarian Party held its first primary of the 2012 election cycle.  Parliamentary advocate James Ogle, the only candidate listed on the ballot, edged ""uncommitted"" 52.7 percent to 47.3 percent to win the majority of votes.  This was something a Libertarian candidate could not accomplish during the 2008 primary, when ""uncommitted"" won a plurality.
 Ogle has operated and promoted a fantasy government project based on the Sainte-Laguë method of voting since 1993. It is known as the USA Parliament. Ogle believes his username for the project — Joogle, a combination of his surname and first and middle initials — served as a basis for the name of the search engine Google; for his campaign, he uses the slogan ""Go Ogle"".
 To appear on the Missouri ballot, Ogle paid a filing fee of $1000. He was the only Libertarian candidate to do so. Ogle thinks this happened because he is ""accessible"" in comparison to his opponents, ""perhaps the other candidates couldn't be reached, and since there was about a 48 hour deadline to file the papers, they either didn't want to spend the $30 on overnight postage, they simply didn't know or else they didn't want to file."" Other candidates for the Libertarian Party nomination, who missed the ballot, include former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson, former air traffic controller RJ Harris, and activist R. Lee Wrights.
 Just before the primary, an article in the Missourian newspaper chronicled Ogle's campaign.  He believes this contributed to his victory.  In the story, he ""was able to explain about ranked choice voting, the Libertarian's philosophy of the non initiation of force, smaller government and more liberty."" In addition, the report mentioned Ogle's desire to be the running mate of Green Party presidential candidate Roseanne Barr.
 According to Ogle: ""the combination of all these events, somehow could have prompted more to ask for the Libertarian ballot when they went to the voting booth.""
 The non-binding primary is the only contest the Libertarian Party will hold before its nominating convention in May. California is also to hold a primary, but it is scheduled after the nomination. Ogle is to appear on the California ballot.
 Republican presidential candidate Hugh Cort, a psychiatrist and President of the non-profit American Foundation for Counter-Terrorism Policy and Research, describes his campaign's status as ""wait-and-see"". In December, he participated in the Republican Party's lesser-known candidates forum, and was included on the New Hampshire Republican primary ballot. He received a total of three votes.
 Nevertheless, Cort's main area of concern is the nuclear situation in Iran, which garnered significant press in February. Iran, which claims it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes, blocked International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors from monitoring a site suspected of containing nuclear weapons research. Increasing western sanctions against the country have resulted in threats from the government that it will cut off oil exports to Europe and/or close the strategic Strait of Hormuz. This talk has affected the price of crude oil. Commentators have suggested that war is looming.
 Cort, who has written a book entitled The American Hiroshima: Iran’s Plan for a Nuclear Attack on the United States, which he gave to Mitt Romney, believes Iran already has a nuclear weapon and that an attack on the United States is ""very likely to happen in the very near future."" He tells Wikinews that if ""Iran does detonate some nuclear bombs in American cities, I would consider continuing my run for President, under the assumption that perhaps America would like to elect someone who knows something about counter-terrorism.""

 Democratic presidential candidate Randall Terry is best known as an anti-abortion advocate. However, he says he is not the ""one-dimensional"" character portrayed in the press. He tells Wikinews that in addition to his activism, he has experience in theology, foreign policy, and music.
 Terry finished second in the Missouri Democratic primary in February and ranks above all primary challengers to President Barack Obama. He received some media attention this month for attempting to run Super Bowl advertisements in Chicago that showed aborted fetuses. A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruling prevented him from showing the ads since he is not on the Illinois Democratic primary ballot. However, after the Super Bowl, Terry was able to target the ads in Oklahoma.  He will be on that state's March 6 primary ballot, and federal law requires stations to show paid advertisements for ""legally qualified candidates"".
 After this and a February 22 Daily Caller report that conservative icon Ann Coulter planned to speak at a Terry fundraiser, Wikinews caught up with Terry.
 ""I have obtained a one-dimensional personality in the news"", says Terry, ""I have a Masters in Diplomacy and International Terrorism from Norwich University...I have a BA in Theology. A BA in Communications from the SUNY [State University of New York]. A daily TV show seen in 44 markets. [And] I have lectured at the Vatican.""  
 He mentions that he authored two papers on Islamic terrorism, which are accessible from his campaign website. These are titled, ""How do the words and deeds of Islamic terrorists, or Muslims who call for acts of terror and violence, emulate the words and deeds of Muhammad?"" and ""Is Islamic Shaira [sic] Law Incompatible With International Laws of Human Rights for Freedom of Thought, Conscience, Religion and Expression?""
 Terry adds, ""I used to be an accomplished musician."" His songs ""I'm Cryin for you Baby"", ""I Do"", ""Te Deum"", ""United We Stand"", and ""Let Those Cookies Burn"" can be heard on his website.

536," Thursday, July 5, 2012 
"," The following is the eighth in a monthly series chronicling the U.S. 2012 presidential election. It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after a brief mention of some of the month's biggest stories.
 In this month's edition on the campaign trail, a Green Party presidential candidate who announced  his 2012 plans to Wikinews four years ago speaks to Wikinews once again, the candidate leading the California American Independent Party presidential primary discusses his campaign, and Wikinews explores whether Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky will be selected as the Republican Party vice presidential nominee.
 In June, California held presidential primary elections for both the Democratic and Republican parties. President Barack Obama was uncontested on the Democratic ballot, and easily won; as did presumptive nominee Mitt Romney on the Republican side. Other presidential primaries in California involved the American Independent, Peace and Freedom, Green, and Libertarian third parties, though not all of these were binding.  In the binding Green primary, physician Jill Stein edged comedienne Roseanne Barr to secure enough delegates to become the party's presumptive presidential nominee. As for other primaries in June, the Republican Party held its final contest in Utah late in the month with Romney easily claiming victory. Afterwards, Fred Karger, the first openly gay presidential candidate for a major party's nomination, officially ended his campaign.
 Starting off, the Obama campaign had a few difficulties in June: a jobs report for the previous month showed a spike in the unemployment rate; Democrats failed to win a recall against the Republican governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin, bolstering Romney's prospects in the state; Romney called Obama ""out of touch"" for his remark that ""The private sector is doing just fine""; and despite Obama's position against extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, former Democratic president Bill Clinton suggested during a CNBC interview that in current circumstances, extending the Bush tax cuts would be ""probably the best thing to do right now.""  Clinton's spokesman later clarified that Clinton backed the president's position. However, consumer advocate and frequent presidential candidate Ralph Nader speculated that Clinton was ""undermining Obama...to appear with Hillary as very friendly to business"" in order to lay the groundwork for a 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential run. 
 The Romney campaign faced a few challenges of its own: reports surfaced that Romney impersonated police officers in his youth; Obama attacked him for his investments' alleged outsourcing of jobs; and vice president Joe Biden discussed his Swiss bank account, portraying him as an elitist at odds with the middle class. Nevertheless, a large amount of Romney coverage in June focused on his search for a running mate. After ABC News reported that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida was not being vetted as a possible vice presidential candidate, Romney disputed the report and claimed that in fact Rubio was being vetting for the nomination. Additionally, two prospects, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, both took their names out of consideration for the spot, though Rice reportedly 'stole the show' at a Romney retreat. At the end of June, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio received increased mention as a potential nominee after Senator John McCain jokingly told a group of Portman interns, ""now you can say you interned for Vice President Portman.""
 In mid-June, Obama injected the issue of immigration into the campaign when he announced by decree that illegal immigrants at most 30 years old who entered the United States before the age of 16 and remain in good standing in their communities, would no longer be deported. During the announcement, Daily Caller reporter Neil Munro interrupted the president to ask how the move would affect American workers. A frustrated Obama acknowledged the interruption, and responded, ""It’s not time for questions, sir...Not while I’m speaking."" The interruption threatened to overshadow Obama's announcement, which analysts suggested was aimed to solidify support among Hispanics. Romney did not explicitly respond to the announcement, but said during an interview with Face the Nation that he instead would implement ""a long-term solution"". About two weeks after the announcement, Washington Post analyst Aaron Blake of Chris Cillizza's The Fix examined polls from Quinnipiac University and reported that though many voters in the swing states of Florida, Pennsylvania, and Ohio favored the new policy, those concerned about the issue were much more likely to oppose it. Blake concluded that the new policy would likely help Obama in the Latino-heavy swing states of Colorado and Nevada, but might possibly hurt him in Pennsylvania and Ohio.
 Other political events shaped the campaign as June came to a close. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as a tax.  Though deemed a political victory for President Obama, Romney proclaimed that the ruling brought a ""greater urgency"" to the election, explaining to his base that repealing the health care bill now required Obama to be voted out of office. In the first three hours after the ruling, the Romney campaign raised one million dollars, a spokesman reported. On the same day as the decision, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to hand over documents related to Operation Fast and Furious. President Obama claimed the documents fell under executive privilege. Many congressional Democrats walked out during the vote and accused Republicans of playing politics. Pollsters said Holder was the most unpopular member of the Obama administration but predicted groups outside the Romney campaign would focus on the issue, in order to not divert Romney from his message on the economy. The Romney campaign ran ads at the end of June that used footage of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, polled as the most popular member of the Obama administration, criticizing Obama during the 2008 primaries for ""perpetuating falsehoods"", concluding with ""Shame on you, Barack Obama."" On June 30, Obama led Romney in the national RealClearPolitics average, 47.5 percent to 43.8 percent.
 In addition to Jill Stein and Roseanne Barr, Kent Mesplay, an air quality inspector from San Diego, participated in June's California Green Party presidential primary. He finished the contest in third place with 10.8 percent behind Stein's nomination-clinching showing of 49.3 percent and Barr's second place 39.9 percent. In the aftermath of the primary and ahead of the July 12–15 Green National Convention, Wikinews reached out to Mesplay.
 Mesplay, who serves as a delegate to the Green National Committee, had previously sought the Green presidential nomination in 2004 and 2008, falling short both times. Wikinews first interviewed Mesplay during his second presidential campaign in June 2008, when he announced his intentions to seek the Green Party's 2012 presidential nomination. During his 2012 bid, Mesplay has campaigned on his support for sustainability, indigenous rights, campaign finance reform, and reductions in military spending. He has received the endorsements of party co-founder John Rensenbrink, 2004 Green Party vice presidential nominee Pat LaMarche, and Green activist Kat Swift.
 With Wikinews, Mesplay discusses his thoughts on Stein and Barr, Green policies in general, and his future political plans.
 ((WSS))  With the outcome of the California primary, physician Jill Stein has secured enough delegates to be the Green Party presumptive presidential nominee. What are your thoughts on Stein and her policy proposals? How do they compare to your own and have you discussed the vice presidential nomination with her?
 ((WSS))  Comedienne Roseanne Barr, who finished second in California, seems to be hinting that she may continue her campaign as an Independent after the National Convention. What is your reaction to Roseanne and her campaign? Has she had a positive influence on the Green Party?
 ((WSS))  When we last interviewed in June 2008, it was under similar circumstances: you were seeking the Green Party presidential nomination; the National Convention was just a few weeks away; and like Stein, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney had already secured enough delegates to be the party's presumptive nominee. At the time, you mentioned that you were ""taking the steps to begin running for the 2012 presidential race."" Now, at this point in the 2012 race, do you have similar plans to run for president in 2016?
 The American Independent Party (AIP), a paleoconservative group formerly affiliated with the Constitution Party  that has guaranteed ballot access in California, listed three presidential candidates on its ballot for June's California primary: the party's former chairman Edward C. Noonan; radio talk show host Laurie Roth; and former United States Army Lieutenant Colonel ""Mad"" Max Riekse.
 In the tally last updated on June 26, Noonan led Roth 16,625 votes (38.8 percent) to 16,044 (37.4 percent) with Riekse polling 10,227 votes (23.8 percent) for third place. Wikinews tried to contact the leading two candidates, but only successfully connected with Noonan.
 Noonan, who ran for both Governor of California in 2006 and U.S. Senate in 2010 as the AIP nominee, told Wikinews that the ""only purpose"" for his run was to ""have standing"" in a lawsuit against President Barack Obama. Noonan, who refers to Obama as ""Mr. Soetero"", said his most recent suit questioning Obama's citizenship was dismissed in court.  He believes Obama's birth certificate ""is forged and a fraudulent document"" due to ""multiple layers of different typewriter font sizes"", signatures in ""multi-colored [ink] and sliced into the document in different patches."" Furthermore, he says that without a legitimate birth certificate, Obama ""cannot prove that he is an American citizen [because his]...birth father was a foreign national from Kenya"". Noonan says that this disqualifies Obama from being president.
 As a candidate, Noonan has sent out press releases and made numerous attempts to spread his message through the internet; however, he has received very little media attention. He argues that people are indifferent to politics and that the ""corrupt news media"" ignores third party candidates such as himself. Additionally, he sees the two major parties as corrupt and refers to them as ""two heads from the same beast."" He describes his opponent Roth as ""a Republican traitor"" and feels the AIP made a mistake by listing such a non-member on the primary ballot.
 Roth, who says she feels God has called her to seek the presidency, unsuccessfully sought the Constitution Party presidential nomination earlier this year. On her website, she calls for the institution of a two percent consumption tax, the eventual repeal of all other taxes, and the elimination of the national debt in four to five years. Ahead of the primary, she received the endorsement of notable birther activist Orly Taitz. Wikinews has made numerous attempts to contact Roth, but has thus far received no response.
 Former congressman Virgil Goode, the Constitution Party's presidential nominee, and Tom Hoefling, the America's Party presidential nominee, are both also reportedly seeking the AIP nomination despite not being listed on the primary ballot. The nominating convention is scheduled to take place August 11.
 After Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky endorsed presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in June, speculation spread that Romney might select Paul as his running mate.  However, according to two political analysts, the scenario is unlikely and may not be strategically wise for Republicans. 
 Paul, who holds libertarian views similar to those of his father, Congressman and 2012 Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul of Texas, announced his endorsement of Romney on Hannity. He cited Romney's support for a Federal Reserve audit, a repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act as rationale for the move. However, Paul did not mention his policy disagreements with Romney on such issues as the War on Drugs, the USA PATRIOT Act, and the foreign policy of the United States. 
 Some libertarians and supporters of Ron Paul reacted angrily to the decision.  The Libertarian Party released a statement saying ""no true libertarian, no true friend of liberty, and no true blue Tea Partier could possibly even consider, much less actually endorse or approve of, the Father of Obamacare, Big Government tax and spender, Republican Mitt Romney.""  
 Nevertheless, some saw it as an attempt for Paul to position himself as a potential vice presidential candidate. Paul said it would be ""a great honor"" for Romney to consider him as a running mate. Proponents of this idea, such as Daniel McCarthy of The American Conservative, say Paul would help steer Republicans and the possible Romney administration away from statist and interventionist policies. Others do not view this as sound campaign strategy.
 According to North Star Opinion Research strategist Dan Judy, the endorsement was simply Paul's ""way of supporting the Republican team and hoping to curry some favor with the Romney folks in hopes of getting his dad a speaking slot at the convention"".  Though Judy held that the pick would help Romney with those concerned about Romney's conservatism such as the ""hard core Tea Party base"", he sees Paul's political inexperience, questionable appeal to political independents and moderates, and the lack of any geographic advantage for the ticket as reasons that the scenario has ""virtually no shot"".
 Political analyst Kyle Kondik of Sabato's Crystal Ball largely agrees, stating that the selection would be a ""real surprise"" and that though ""supporters of Ron and Rand Paul are a vocal part of the Republican Party, they are but one small constituency, and their views, particularly on matters of war and peace, are too different from Romney and the Republican mainstream to imagine Rand (or Ron) in the No. 2 slot on the ticket.""

543," Friday, February 9, 2018 "," On Wednesday morning, US poet, lyricist, and digital rights activist John Perry Barlow died in his sleep at his San Francisco home. The announcement of his death specified no cause, but reportedly Barlow had recently experienced debilitating health problems. The co-founder of the digital rights legal defense non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and former lyricist of rock band Grateful Dead was 70.  The EFF announced his death.
 Barlow composed lyrics for the Grateful Dead, several songs for the psychedelic rock band over almost 25 years. In the 1990s, he shifted his focus to the Internet, composing essays on Internet culture and working with the EFF to protect digital rights.
 Born to Republican state legislator Norman Barlow and his wife Miriam, Barlow was raised on the Bar Cross Ranch in Pinedale, Wyoming. Barlow became friends with future Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir in high school before attending Wesleyan University in Middleton, Connecticut, where he studied comparative religion. During his studies, Barlow began visiting LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) drug advocate Timothy Leary.
 After graduation in 1969, he opted to travel the world and returned to his family's ranch in 1971.  With his father ill from a stroke, the younger Barlow began ranching before Weir contacted him to finish songs for the latter's solo album Ace. The collaboration continued with the Grateful Dead and their individual members, with Barlow contributing occasional lyrics until the band's 1995 dissolution. In 1977, he married Elaine Parker. He sold the family ranch in 1988 due to financial strain.
 Barlow became interested in the online world in the 1980s, including becoming a leader at on-line forum the WELL. In 1990, Barlow was interrogated by an Federal Bureau of Investigation agent about possible connections to underground hackers. He posted his experience to the WELL and discovered that Mitch Kapor had had a similar encounter. The duo decided to join together to help provide legal defense for the hackers and formally incorporated the EFF, adding to the EFF board Stewart Brand, John Gilmore, and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Wozniak. He served on the board of the EFF until his death. He and Elaine divorced in 1995. He met Cynthia Horner in 1993 and was briefly engaged to her before her unexpected death from an undiagnosed health condition at the age of 29.
 In addition to digital activism, Barlow was an early commentator on Internet culture, writing several pieces for Wired in its early years and penning essays such as ""A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace"" (1996) that helped define digital citizenship. In 1998 he became a fellow of Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society and in 2013 he was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame. Barlow stayed active in issues related to civil liberties and rights, helping to create the Freedom of the Press Foundation in 2012. Although he had mostly retired from songwriting, he contributed to several songs by jam band The String Cheese Incident.
 Barlow suffered a major heart attack in 2015. By late 2016, he faced several serious health conditions, leading several musicians to hold a benefit concert for him to raise funds for his medical bills. He recently completed his memoir Mother American Night, slated for release on June 5.
 Barlow is survived by his ex-wife Elaine Parker Barlow; the couple's three daughters Leah Justine, Anna Winter, and Amelia Rose; and a granddaughter.

"," Retired West Virginia engineer Lowell Jackson ""Jack"" Fellure won the presidential nomination of the Prohibition Party yesterday at the party's National Convention in Cullman, Alabama. He won on the second ballot, defeating Thompson Township tax accessor James Hedges of Pennsylvania, who initially ran unopposed. Party Chairman Toby Davis of Mississippi received the vice presidential nomination.
 The Prohibition Party is the third oldest existing political party in the United States, having been established in 1869. It reached its height of popularity during the late 19th century. As its name suggests, the party heavily supported the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which banned the sale of alcohol, and resulted in the US period known as Prohibition (1919–33). The party has declined since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, but has continued to nominate candidates for the presidential election.
 Fellure, 79, has run for president in every election since 1988, though usually as a Republican. This run marks his first as a member of the Prohibition Party. On his campaign website, he cites the Authorized 1611 King James Bible as his presidential platform, and calls for the teaching of the Bible in public schools, criminalization of homosexuality, and the elimination of abortion, the liquor industry and pornography. On economics, he supports reducing taxes and balancing the federal budget.
 Hedges, the first Prohibition Party member elected to public office since 1959, announced his campaign in February 2010, and was the only candidate until last month. According to Vice Chairman June Griffin: ""While Jim has contributed valuable resources to this Party...his positions regarding Environmentalism and passivity toward war forced me to vote for Jack Fellure. As well, his insistence on a moratorium on the building of nuclear plants caused much unrest among the membership. Yet he prevailed to install this plank."" 
 The ten voting Prohibition Party convention delegates and a few guests met for the National Convention, which began on Monday at the Holiday Inn Express in Cullman. Tuesday featured a short greeting from Cullman Mayor Max Townson, followed by addresses from Libertarian consultant Stephen P. Gordon, Ballot Access News publisher Richard Winger, and Eunie Smith of the Eagle Forum.
 Gordon, who previously worked as the e-Campaign manager for the 2008 Bob Barr presidential campaign, jokingly commented that his speech ""stunk"". He opened his address with the joke that ""the way to pick out the libertarian at a Prohibition Party function is that I’m the one wearing the Jerry Garcia tie."" He discussed how third party candidates could utilize new media to their advantage, but avoided any ideological topics.
 Winger, an expert on election law, discussed ballot access and the history of the Prohibition Party. He notably explained how the party had cost the Republicans presidential victories in the elections of 1884 and 1916, which forestalled the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment by Republicans, who wanted to do away with the alcohol issue. Gordon later commented that Winger's speech was well-received by the audience.
 After Winger's speech, the convention broke for lunch. Afterwards, Smith, the widow of former Congressman Albert L. Smith, Jr., focused on immigration and education in her address. When asked about the Eagle Forum's participation in the fight against alcohol, she commented that the group was focused on more pressing issues such as gambling.
 After the nomination, some party members traveled to the grave of Sidney Catts in Florida. Catts, who died in 1936, was the first and only state governor elected from the Prohibition Party.

"," Despite repeatedly saying that he would not endorse a particular candidate for this November's U.S. presidential election, Republican Congressman Ron Paul made a surprise statement Monday afternoon in which he announced that he was supporting Constitution Party nominee Chuck Baldwin.
 This comes after Libertarian Party nominee former congressman Bob Barr's controversial last minute refusal to attend Paul's third party unity conference at the National Press Club in Washington, DC nearly two weeks ago. 
 Instead, Barr held a press conference of his own a few hours later at the same location. In it he announced that he did not care about third party candidates getting a large amount of votes in the election, only himself. This statement caused Barr to rapidly decrease in voter popularity over the following week. Many of his former supporters have since joined Baldwin's and Independent Ralph Nader's presidential campaigns.
 ""I’ve thought about the unsolicited advice from the Libertarian Party candidate,"" Paul said Monday. ""He has convinced me to reject my neutral stance in the November election. I’m supporting Chuck Baldwin, the Constitution Party candidate.""

"," Republican Congressman Ron Paul of Texas announced Tuesday that he will end his twelve-term career in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013 when his current term expires.  He will not seek re-election in 2012, but rather will focus fully on his campaign to win the presidential nomination of the Republican Party. He previously mounted two unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 1988 and 2008.  
 Paul, 75, has held his House seat for Texas's 14th congressional district since 1997, and previously held another House seat for Texas from 1976 to 1977 and 1979 to 1985.  He ran for president as the Libertarian Party's nominee in 1988, but finished in third place with approximately 0.47 percent of the vote.  Paul later returned to the Republican Party and Congress in the 1990s, and sought the party's 2008 presidential nomination while simultaneously running for re-election in the House. Despite an enthusiastic internet following that broke fundraising records, he lost the nomination to Senator John McCain of Arizona.  
 Nevertheless, Paul feels better about his chances to win the 2012 nomination, stating ""We have a lot more support right now, things are doing well for us.""  According to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal Republican presidential poll, Paul is tied with Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota for second place with 11 percent, behind former Governor Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who stands at 43 percent. 
 Paul, who won re-election in 2010 with 76 percent of the vote, commented that his early announcement would give political aspirants plenty of time to decide to run for his seat, which represents ten counties along the Texas Gulf Coast.

"," In late October, supporters of United States Republican candidate-for-President Ron Paul set up a website soliciting a ""money bomb"" of campaign donations to coincide with November 5th, the anniversary of Guy Fawkes Day, at ThisNovember5th.com.
 The fund-raising campaign fell short of its original goal of 100,000 donors each donating US$100 to generate $10 million for Paul's campaign.  However, the final amount raised by over 35,000 Ron Paul donors was over $4 million.  This is the largest fundraising day in primary history since John Kerry's 2004 acceptance of the Democratic nomination. It was originally reported that on June 30, 2007 Hillary Clinton raised $6.5 million. According to the Paul campaign, though Clinton reported all that money on June 30th, it was in fact raised over the course of a week, not in a single day.
 Paul is running for the Republican nomination but self-identifies as a libertarian. Although Paul has been successful online, in straw polls, in debate polls, in fundraising, and in turnouts at rallies, his national polling has remained in the single digits.

"," Former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson ended his campaign for the Republican Party (GOP) presidential nomination to seek the backing of the Libertarian Party (LP). Johnson made the announcement yesterday during a press conference in Santa Fe. He remarked that it ""was both a difficult decision - and an easy one...I have a lot of Republican history, and a lot of Republican supporters. But in the final analysis...I am a Libertarian - that is someone who is fiscally very conservative but holds freedom-based positions on the issues that govern our personal behavior.""
 Johnson, who supports abortion rights, gay marriage, and marijuana legalization, had trouble gaining support for his GOP candidacy.  He remained low in the polls and was invited to only two of the fifteen presidential debates. His name was often not included in surveys, and he filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission after his exclusion from the November 12 CBS debate. He criticized the GOP establishment for failing to support his efforts. A switch to the LP had been expected for Johnson who argued that ""the [GOP] process was not fair and open.""
 Democratic strategist Stanley Greenberg argued that ""almost any third party helps [President Barack] Obama."" A recent poll from Public Policy Polling shows Johnson with nine percent national support in a three-way race with Obama and GOP candidate Mitt Romney. Johnson's presence in the poll erases Romney's two percent lead in a head-to-head match up with Obama, giving the president a two point edge. Johnson's 20 to 23 percent support in his home state of New Mexico splits the vote to give Obama an easy victory in the state. 
 Nevertheless, Johnson seems to believe he can win. In his announcement, he pointed to a survey showing that ""sixty three percent of Americans said they wished there was a third choice for 2012."" He maintains that he is that choice.
 Johnson joins the field of nine candidates currently seeking the LP nomination including National Guard officer R.J. Harris and Libertarian activist R. Lee Wrights. The party will hold its nominating convention on May 5.

"," With the U.S. presidential election looming, former New Mexico governor and current Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson spoke with Wikinews reporter William S. Saturn on an assortment of economic, foreign, and social issues. In the interview, Johnson makes his final plea to voters before they cast their ballots on Election Day, November 6.
 Though a member of the Libertarian Party in the early 1990s, Johnson was elected and re-elected governor of New Mexico in 1994 and 1998 as a Republican.  During his governorship, he vetoed over 750 bills, more than all other then-governors combined, and left the state with a $1 billion budget surplus. He briefly ran for president as a Republican in 2011 before rejoining the Libertarian Party to seek its 2012 presidential nomination.
 After winning the nomination this past May, Johnson has campaigned throughout the nation espousing the Fair Tax, spending cuts across the board, a repeal of Obamacare, an audit of the Federal Reserve, a non-interventionist foreign policy, an end to the Drug War, and legalization of same-sex marriage. He and his running mate, Judge Jim Gray of California, have attained ballot access in all U.S. states except Michigan, where he is a write-in candidate, and Oklahoma. Nationally, he has received four percent registered-voter support in the past two CNN/Opinion Research Polls that included him with President Barack Obama, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Green Party nominee Jill Stein. It is the campaign's goal to reach five percent on Election Day, which will enable the party to receive ballot access and federal funding on par with the two major parties.
 With Wikinews, Johnson discusses the federal budget, education, entitlements, the Syrian uprising, Mexican Drug War, same-sex marriage, the Libertarian Party, and his political future.
 ((William S. Saturn)) :You say that as president, you would propose a balanced budget ""not five or ten years down the road"" but in 2013. Realistically can that budget pass, especially with a Congress hostile to your proposed spending cuts and tax plan? 
 ((WSS)) You also propose decreasing federal education spending including decreases in Pell Grants and loans for college students. Is that correct?
 ((WSS)) So it wouldn't be an immediate cut?
 ((WSS)) Okay. I have a question here about entitlements: During the Tea Party Republican Party Debate on September 12, 2011, one of which you were not invited to, Wolf Blitzer [the debate’s moderator], he provided the following scenario to Ron Paul, this is what he said, he said:
 Now Ron Paul answered that question. If you were at that debate, how would you have responded to that?
 ((William S. Saturn)) Let's shift to foreign affairs. On your website, you say ""America simply cannot afford to be engaged in foreign policy programs that are not clearly protecting U.S. interests."" In the case of a humanitarian crisis as in Syria right now, does the U.S. ever have a moral obligation to intervene militarily even if it is not clearly in the U.S. interest?
 ((WSS)) Let's say it's like Hitler's Germany, would intervention be necessary then?
 ((WSS)) You were the governor of a border state. As president, what would you do to prevent the violence in Mexico from spilling over into the United States?
 ((WSS)) But as president, would you increase border security or would you keep it the same?
 ((William S. Saturn)) Let's get into social issues now. You criticized President Obama for his stance that same-sex marriage be left to the states. With the Tenth Amendment in mind, why should same-sex marriage be a federal issue and why should the federal government mandate that states allow same sex marriage?
 ((William S. Saturn)) Okay I'm getting to my final questions here. I want to talk about the Libertarian Party. The first nominee of the Party was John Hospers, who died last year, and he was a supporter of Republican President George W. Bush. The next nominee Roger MacBride also left the party and went to the Republican Party. The 1988 nominee Ron Paul, as we all know, serves in the House of Representatives as a member of the Republican Party, and his son [Rand Paul] serves in the Senate as a member of the Republican Party. Both the 2008 presidential and vice-presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party: Bob Barr and Wayne Allyn Root have recently rejoined the Republican Party and have both endorsed Mitt Romney for president.  In fact, until the end of last year, you too were a member of the Republican Party. So why does it seem Libertarians flock to the Republican Party?
 ((WSS)) But you admit that there are some Liberty Republicans and that Republicans make up a large portion of libertarians. Is that correct?
 ((WSS)) Well let's say someone is a libertarian-leaning Republican like Rand Paul in the Senate. Should such libertarian Republicans support you and guaranteeing their vote will go to you rather than voting Republican...Let me rephrase this question... Let's say that a Rand Paul Republican was considering who to vote for and they could choose between guaranteeing their vote would not go to the Republican, which they see as the small-government alternative in the duopoly, rather than voting Republican and ensuring their vote will go to someone who they believe is the small government alternative, should they still support you?
 ((WSS)) This is my final question here. The OC Weekly website reported last week that your running mate, Judge Jim Gray remarked during an appearance at Tulane University that you two plan to run again in 2016. Can you confirm whether that is correct?

552," Thursday, October 29, 2020 "," Professor Jo Jorgensen of South Carolina, the U.S. Libertarian Party's 2020 presidential nominee, answered some questions about her campaign from Wikinews accredited reporter William S. Saturn.
 Jorgensen is a psychology professor at Clemson University.   In 1992, with the Libertarian Party's backing, she ran for public office, seeking South Carolina's 4th congressional seat in the United States House of Representatives.  She finished the race in third place with almost 2.16 percent of the total vote. Four years later, the Libertarian Party tapped Jorgensen to be its vice presidential nominee.  She joined a ticket with the late Harry Browne.  Browne-Jorgensen appeared on every state ballot and received a total of 485,798 votes, which was roughly 0.5 percent. This marked the best performance for the party since 1980 and would not be topped percentage-wise until 2012 when former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson attained 0.99 percent of the vote.  Johnson bested that performance in 2016 as the party's presidential nominee for a second time, earning 3.27 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for the party  since its 1971 inception.
 For the 2020 nomination, Jorgensen navigated through a primary campaign that featured the short-lived campaigns of former Rhode Island governor Lincoln Chafee and Congressman Justin Amash of Michigan, the first sitting Congressman to be a member of the Libertarian Party.  At the virtual 2020 Libertarian National Convention, Jorgensen won the nomination on the fourth ballot, edging attorney Jacob Hornberger, performance artist Vermin Supreme and activist Adam Kokesh, among others.  Podcaster Spike Cohen, originally the running mate of Supreme, was picked to be the party's vice presidential nominee.  Cohen spoke to Wikinews back in June.  The Jorgensen-Cohen ticket has since secured ballot access in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
 As a libertarian, an ideology that advocates for lesser government, both in the social and economic realms, Jorgensen's issue positions include a mix of traditionally liberal and conservative stances.  She supports both LGBT rights and gun rights.  She opposes the police state and the taxing authority equally.  And, she supports an open immigration policy while arguing against the welfare state. 
 With Wikinews, Jorgensen discusses her background, COVID-19, her potential cabinet, gridlock, and an assortment of issues including climate change, foreign affairs, free speech, and race relations.

"," R.J. Harris, a potential candidate for the U.S. Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, took some time to speak with Accredited Wikinews Reporter William Saturn about his campaign and issues positions.
 Harris is an officer in the United States Army National Guard, currently serving in Afghanistan.  He is also in his third year as a law student at the University of Oklahoma College of Law.  Harris previously worked as an Air Traffic Controller and small business owner. He plans to enter the race in September after completing his tour in Afghanistan.
 Others seeking the nomination include Libertarian activist R. Lee Wrights, radio host Jim Duensing, former Nevada Libertarian Party chair Jim Burns, marketing executive Roger Gary and attorney Carl Person. 2008 Vice presidential nominee Wayne Allyn Root is also expected to make a run.
 Ten personal questions were asked followed by ten policy questions.
 ((William Saturn)) What are your some of your personal achievements?
 ((R.J. Harris)) Being chosen by Jennifer R. Friend and her family to be her husband and keeping them happy for the last 20 years. Helping her raise our five children. Serving as a Soldier and Officer of the Republic for the last 20 years at home and on four deployments with honor, award and distinction. 
 Completing my training and certification as an Air Traffic Controller in the Federal Aviation Administration. Continuing my education in Philosophy and Law when time, convenience and the rigors of leading a family easily could have dissuaded me. 
 Running a principled U.S. Congressional Campaign which was based upon the Constitution and the Philosophy of Liberty and which NEVER personally attacked my opponent but engaged him rigorously on policy and the issues. Getting up, when Life knocks me down.         
 ((WS)) What are your goals in life?
 ((RH)) To love and be loved by my family. To reason well. To be Free. To protect the innocent. To defend the Lives, Liberty and Property of my fellow Citizens of the Republic. To restore the Constitution and the Republic. To help ensure our Founders' vision of Freedom is finally realized by the entire body politic.  
 ((WS)) Have you ever been arrested or charged with a crime?
 ((RH)) No.
 ((WS)) What historical or contemporary figures do you admire?
 ((RH)) The Philosophers who argued for the importance of Reason, Freedom and Liberty. The statespersons who were audacious enough to put those philosophies into practice, even at the expense of their own Lives, Liberty or Property. 
 Every single Soldier, Sailor, Airperson, Marine, Doctor and/or Nurse who has fought with honor to defend the Republic, even if I will never know all their names, as well as their spouses who supported them in that endeavor. Every person -- great and not -- who has struggled for the full equality of the body politic. 
 First among these for me are King Leonidas, Pericles , Jesus, Cicero, Pelagius, Galileo Galilei, Leonardo Da Vinci, Sir Isaac Newton, John Locke, Voltaire, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Paine, John Paul Jones, Fredric Bastiat, Abraham Lincoln, Fredrick Douglass, Col. Robert Gould Shaw, Settainte (White Bear), Set-ankeah (Sitting Bear), George Patton, John F. Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Charles Allen Rochelle, Dr. Richard Michael Settainte Harris, Sam W. Barnes, Ron Paul and Rand Paul. Aspasia, Hypatia, Mary Magdalene, every woman tortured to death for refusing to either declare herself a witch (or renounce the same) to the Church, Anne Boleyn, Mary Wollstonecraft, Betsy Ross, Annie Oakley, Molly Brown, Marilyn Monroe, Jacqueline Onassis Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, Rosalie Rochelle, Nicole Kidman, Danica Patrick, Debra Medina, D. Jill Barnes, and Jennifer R. Harris.      
 ((WS)) Who did you support in the 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 presidential elections?
 ((RH)) Pat Buchanan, George W. Bush, George W. Bush, Ron Paul. Earlier on in my adult life, my political activities were limited to voting for the same party candidates as had my parents. However, as I began to read the Constitution thoroughly, and in the wake of its many abuses perpetrated by those same candidates, I began looking for others who espoused to strictly follow the Constitution as well as the Founders' Philosophies which underlie it. 
 This pursuit led me to Ron Paul and the discovery of Libertarianism. I will never again vote for any candidate based upon their party affiliation. What will now and forever dominate my decision is a candidate's demonstrated commitment to the Constitution and the Philosophy of Liberty.  
 ((WS)) Have you run for public office previously?
 ((RH)) Yes, I was a U.S. Congressional Candidate from Oklahoma's 4th District. Due to no ballot access in Oklahoma for Libertarian Party Candidates at that time, I ran as a ""Ron Paul"" Libertarian Republican. Though Ron himself has a policy of non-endorsement of GOP [Republican] primary challengers against GOP incumbents, I was able to secure the endorsement of Senator Rand Paul for my congressional campaign.   
 ((WS)) Why did you choose to run as a Libertarian?
 ((RH)) Because no other party so ardently champions the Philosophy of Liberty over Socialism and Constitutional Governance over Tyranny. Were they alive today, every single one of the Founders would be Libertarians. Since that age, each new generation's battle to tear down the scourges of racism, sexism, classism, bigotry, political persecution and/or religious intolerance, has been made possible by appeal to the principles espoused in the Constitution even if the people who ratified it were limited by the tolerance levels of their own generation. 
 Thus has the time come for candidates running on our Founders' Platform to rise up, proud of the political lineage whose generations' long aim has been the complete equality of the body politic, yet humble and weary of how prejudice undermines that legacy as well as the Philosophy of Liberty itself. Giving in to socialism will not erase the moral mistakes of the past, but it will return our children to the states of slavery and involuntary servitude against which we have so long struggled. 
 ((WS)) What do you feel sets you apart from your fellow contenders for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination?
 ((RH)) I do more than preach Libertarianism, or prognosticate about all the ways the GOP or the DNC [Democrat] candidates will most certainly carry on with their tyrannies and usurpations of power, given the opportunity. 
 I articulate bold policy positions, as well as the means to institute them, based upon the Philosophy of Liberty and the Constitution with the aim of restoring Freedom, Liberty and the Republic. This is the definition of political courage, as taking these strong positions makes me a target for the bullets and blows of the enemies of Liberty. 
 But we are in the fight of our age and we must have champions willing to trade blows with the enemy, not merely repeat Libertarian platitudes.  Educational campaigns have been the mainstay of the Libertarian Party since its founding; but if we are going to take that next step — to actually convince the body politic that we can put into policy that which we preach, then we must nominate a candidate who is not afraid step out, armed with the courage of conviction and lead on every issue. 
 Of course our ability to do this is tied to cogent articulation of the philosophy which underlies our political ideology, but for too long have our other candidates engaged in academic debates for their own sake, and not actually deigned to apply that for which they argue to that which they will do. That being said, the biggest thing that separates me from my Libertarian Colleagues is that I am not running this race merely to educate or to increase the Party's ballot access; I am running to win and I believe with all my heart that we can be -- and that we must be -- victorious.   
 ((WS)) How often do you campaign and how would that change if you won the nomination?
 ((RH)) I campaign for several hours each day. Once I win the nomination the only thing that will change is that I will have to add much more travel to the schedule. 
 ((WS)) If elected, what would you do as president?
 ((RH)) I will defend the Republic and the Lives, Liberty and Property of We the People. This I will do by way of projecting to the world our strength at home and in International Waters; and by ending all government infringements of the Constitution and of the People's Natural Rights. The authority to act on this promise is found in the President's constitutional Oath of Office to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" I will do no more than this and certainly no less.
 ((William Saturn)) What necessary freedoms are currently lacking in American society?
 ((R.J. Harris)) With the exception of the 3rd Amendment, the Natural Rights codified in, and the privileges and immunities established by, the remaining nine amendments of the Bill of Rights, along with elements of the 13th and 14th amendments, are routinely infringed by all three branches of the federal government through their collective and Progressive Establishment of Socialism in place of Freedom and Liberty. 
 These charges are made manifest by appeal to some of the very same made by the Founders of this Republic against the King of England for promulgating some of the same tyrannies which are now being foisted upon We the People by our own federal government. 
 To enumerate only a few levied by the Declaration of Independence our federal government has 
 1. ""…erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their Substance."" 
 2. ""…kept among us, in Times of Peace, [and at our expense] standing Armies…"" 
 3. ""…combined with others [NATO and the United Nations] to subject us to a Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving [its] Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation."" 
 4. ""…[cut]off our Trade with all Parts of the World [for products or services with which the elected majority finds disfavor]"" 
 5. ""…[imposed] taxes upon us without our consent [by way of deficit spending which will have to be repaid by those not yet old enough to vote]"" 
 6. ""…suspended Habeas Corpus and deprived ""…us in many Cases of the Benefits of Trial by Jury [The Patriot Act and GITMO] 
 7. ""…[taken] away our Charters, [abolished] our most valuable Laws, and [altered] fundamentally the Forms of our Governments"" [this referring to the federal government's many infringements of out states' sovereignty] 
 8. ""…[declared] themselves invested with Power to legislate for us in [nearly] all Cases whatsoever"" [by way of gross misuse of the Commerce Clause, the Supremacy Clauses as well as many others to pass, sign and uphold onerous legislation which would never be countenanced by a free People] 
 9. waged the Drug and Terror ""…War(s) against us [and in so doing] has plundered our Seas, ravaged our Coasts, burned [or seized] our [property], [invaded our privacy, killed citizens attempting to defend their property, sexually assaulted women and children attempting to travel] and destroyed the Lives of our People.""
 ""In every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble Terms [by begging for the cessation of: bailouts (TARP), social welfares (Obama Care), undeclared foreign Wars (Korea, Vietnam, Somalia, Iraq and Libya), taxation without representation and the devaluation of our Wealth (deficit spending and the over-printing of a declining and unconstitutional paper currency), the theft and destruction of our Property (Eminent Domain) along with the killing and incarceration of our People (the Civil War on Drugs), the sexual assault of our Women and Children in the name of security (TSA), the gross infringements of our Privacy (the Patriot Act) ]: 
 Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated Injury [after TARP came bailouts for a host of corporations, the social welfares are too numerous to list, the War in Libya goes on despite its gross unconstitutionality as does the War in Afghanistan despite having met the objectives contained in the Letter of Reprisal authorizing our actions there, the debt limit is about to be raised once again, the Federal Reserve continues its quantitative easing (money printing), the Civil War on Drugs rages on despite the previous failure of prohibition and trillions spent to curb private behavior in the name of morality all to no avail, the sexual assaults being perpetrated by the TSA continue despite several state legislatures attempting to nullify them, the Patriot Act was just extended and all of this despite most of these actions not having the approval of the VAST majority of the People]. 
 A Prince [or central Government] whose Character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the Ruler of a free People."" 
 It should be clear then by the enumeration of this ""long Train of Abuses and Usurpations,"" which represents but a tiny fraction of the same which our central government is using to pursue ""invariably the same Object"" and that it ""evinces a Design to reduce [us] under absolute Despotism."" 
 Thus by the precedent established by the Declaration of Independence, and the Founding of the Republic itself under similar, if not even less trying circumstances, that it is the Right and Duty of We the People to use the political process still available to us to ""throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for [our] future Security"" as well as restore our Constitution and our Republic. 
 As a potential Candidate for the Libertarian Party's Presidential Nomination I would encourage the People to begin this restorative political process by electing to the Office of President the MOST Constitutionally Libertarian Candidate available and to continue it by doing the same in the election of all future federal representatives to the Congress REGARDLESS of their perceived political experience. 
 For certainly it is the case that nearly every single member of all three branches of the federal government are very experienced career politicians and yet the state of our Republic and the condition of our Freedom and Liberty are worse off now that they have been at any time since our founding.                
 ((WS)) When is government necessary?
 ((RH)) To protect the Lives, Liberty and Property of the Citizens of the Republic.
 ((WS)) In a market with little or no government regulation, what prevents an entity from seizing the entire means of production and becoming the new main regulator?
 ((RH)) The freedom and innovation of inventors and the entrepreneurialism of their investors to produce substitute markets, products and/or services to compete with any of the same being seized or monopolized.  
 ((WS)) In context of government's role, what are your stands on the legality of incest, bestiality and child pornography?
 ((RH)) As reprehensible as are incest and bestiality, policing them remains a matter of state sovereignty under the 10th Amendment. However, allowance of child pornography entails the government's enforcement of 5th, 13th and 14th Amendment violations against children and could therefore be policed by the Federal Government should the States or Native Nations fail to do so.   
 ((WS)) Do you disagree with any parts of the Bill of Rights?
 ((RH)) No.
 ((WS)) Should the people of the United States have a right to constitutionally amend the Bill of Rights to increase the power of the federal government and limit individual rights?
 ((RH)) Yes, according to Locke, our Founders, Bastiat and the Philosophy of Liberty, no government actions conducted outside the consent of the People are legitimate. The Constitution is our codification of that consent and, as such, it is supreme over all other political ideologies. Of course I would very publicly argue, using the Philosophy of Liberty, for the People to NEVER consider such measures but it is their right to affect them by way of the amendment process. 
 ((WS)) Should the lives of American citizens be valued above citizens of other nations?
 ((RH)) As it applies to the Natural Rights, those being Life, Liberty and Property, of all People found to be under the jurisdiction of the United States; no. However, as it applies to providing for the common Defense of We the People and the Republic; yes.      
 ((WS)) What are your views on immigration?
 ((RH)) I will fight to eliminate the social welfare state and the high taxes required to pay for it, which are chasing our jobs and prosperity overseas. Simultaneously, I will seek from the Congress a very robust and permissive immigration policy to help grow our middle class, making us more competitive with other emerging markets around the world.
 I will deploy the U.S. Marshals backed up by the National Guard to protect Border State property owners from violent cross-border organized crime enterprises and syndicates. 
 ((WS)) When is war necessary?
 ((RH)) When the Lives, Liberty or Property of We the People are being infringed by a foreign entity.
 ((WS)) Are you a truther, birther, neither or both?
 ((RH)) Neither, although I do intend to ensure the highest level of executive and administrative transparency which will do much to resolve the propensity of some towards conspiracy theories, as well as expose potential conspiracies before they can fully develop. Since this transparency has been sorely lacking from our government of late, I will direct the Department of Justice to fully investigate any reasonably perceived recent lapses in the executive oversight of the federal government's activities.

"," R. Lee Wrights, a candidate for the U.S. Libertarian Party's presidential nomination, took some time to speak with Accredited Wikinews Reporter William Saturn about his presidential campaign and positions on political issues.
 Wrights, a native of North Carolina, is an activist and lifetime member of the Libertarian Party who currently serves as the editor of several Libertarian publications.  He previously worked as a medical technician in the United States Air Force and earned degrees in History and Journalism at Willmar College.  
 He is currently being challenged for the nomination by National Guard officer R.J. Harris, radio host Jim Duensing, former Nevada Libertarian Party chair Jim Burns, marketing executive Roger Gary and attorney Carl Person. 2008 Vice presidential nominee Wayne Allyn Root is also expected to make a run.
 Ten personal questions were asked followed by ten policy questions. 
 ((William Saturn)) What are some of your personal achievements?
 ((R. Lee Wrights)) Founder and editor of LibertyForAll.net, America's premier online libertarian newsletter.
 Leading the most-successful volunteer ballot access drive for the Libertarian Party of North Carolina.
Serving three terms on the Libertarian National Committee; one term as Vice Chair.
 President of the Foundation for a Free Society, a 501c3 non-profit educational organization dedicated to promoting the principles of liberty, personal sovereignty, private property, and free markets in order to create a more free and prosperous society.
 ((WS)) What are your goals in life?
 ((RW)) Right now I am focused on bringing a peaceful America to my children and grandchildren.
 ((WS)) Have you ever been arrested or charged with a crime?
 ((RW)) No.
 ((WS)) What historical or contemporary figures do you admire?
 ((RW)) I admire most of the Founders, but especially Thomas Jefferson and James Madison.
 ((WS)) Who did you support in the 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 presidential elections?
 ((RW)) Harry Browne, Harry Browne, Michael Badnarik, Mary Ruwart
 ((WS)) Have you run for public office previously?
 ((RW)) A couple of times for local offices, however, I have managed numerous campaigns for other candidates at the local, state and national level.
 ((WS)) Why did you choose to run as a Libertarian?
 ((RW)) I am seeking the nomination because the Libertarian Party faces a critical test in 2012 and I want to make sure that we're up to the challenge.  The Libertarian message in 2012 must be loud, clear and unequivocal call to – stop all war! We must stop the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we must stop the War on Drugs and Alternative Lifestyles, we must Stop the War on Civil Liberties, we must stop the wars on food, healthcare, guns – you name it.	
 ((WS)) What do you feel sets you apart from your fellow contenders for the Libertarian Party presidential nomination?
 ((RW)) I've been active in the Libertarian Party and libertarian movement all my adult life. I've never been afraid to passionately champion the unvarnished libertarian message of individual liberty and personal responsibility. Other candidates have tried to refine, revise or remake the libertarian message in order to appeal to voters. That tactic has failed not only the party, but the cause of liberty, as well. Instead, I propose to embrace the principled libertarian message and will not be afraid to speak truth to power.	
 ((WS)) How often do you campaign and how would that change if you won the nomination?
 ((RW)) I am campaigning every day, either in person, online or on the phone and that will not change when I am honored with the Libertarian Party nomination.
 ((WS)) If elected, what would you do as president?
 ((RW)) My first order of business will be to disengage the United States from the tangle of misguided, immoral and unconstitutional military conflicts we are involved in by using the same authority and power as Commander-in-Chief so many presidents have abused to get us mired in these quagmires in the first place. 
 ((WS)) What necessary freedoms are currently lacking in American society?
 ((RW)) All our freedoms are currently under attack by Democratic and Republican politicians who have conjured up myriads of excuses, ""imaginary hobgoblins"" to wage war on American citizens and the world. They have manipulated events to distract, divide and terrorize Americans into willingly sacrificing their liberty before the great false god of Security. 
 ((WS)) When is government necessary?
 ((RW)) Government is only necessary to protect individual life, liberty and property. The only just and ""necessary"" government is one, as James Madison said, ""which impartially secures to every man whatever is his own.""
 ((WS)) In a market with little or no government regulation, what prevents an entity from seizing the entire means of production and becoming the new main regulator?
 ((RW)) Government regulation is in reality a method by which large businesses with power and influence use government power to benefit themselves at the expense of smaller competitors. In a truly free market, there will always be competition to prevent one entity from seizing the entire means of production. 
 ((WS)) In context of government's role, what are your stands on the legality of incest, bestiality and child pornography?
 ((RW)) While these practices might be repulsive to most people, as they are to me, government cannot stop them from happening. Libertarians believe people should be free to make choice for themselves about their lifestyle, so long as they do not harm others. In all cases where violations of human rights occur, the proper role of government is to prosecute those who have committed the violation.
 ((WS)) Do you disagree with any parts of the Bill of Rights?
 ((RW)) No, except that I believe the Second Amendment should have been the first.
 ((WS)) Should the people of the United States have a right to constitutionally amend the Bill of Rights to increase the power of the federal government and limit individual rights?
 ((RW)) No individual, or groups of individuals, has the right to limit another individual's rights. Our rights come from our Creator, not from any government or document. Two people, 200 people, 2 million people, even the world's populations combined do not have more rights than one person. That is why when it comes to human rights, no number is greater than one.
 ((WS)) Should the lives of American citizens be valued above citizens of other nations?
 ((RW)) No. All human beings have equal value. No race, color, creed, nationality, language group, ethnic group – no human being – is of more value than any other. We are all equal under the Creator. Freedom has no race. Liberty knows no color.
 ((WS)) What are your views on immigration?
 ((RW)) The so-called ""illegal immigration"" issue is an economic issue and should be treated as such. We must change immigration law to match the reality of a dynamic society and labor market. Instead of building walls we should be opening doors. America should be creating a sane and humane immigration process to screen out terrorists and criminals while allowing honest, peaceful, hardworking people to come here to work and help build on the American dream as millions have done before them. 
 ((WS)) When is war necessary?
 ((RW)) As C.K. Chesterton said, ""The only defensible war is a war of defense."" The libertarian principle of non-aggression does not mean you can't defend yourself. If the United States is attacked, we should defend ourselves using whatever force is necessary, and all the power at our disposal to stop the attack quickly and decisively. But we do not have the right to maintain an occupation force or engage in ""nation building"" in the aggressor nation.
 ((WS)) Are you a truther, birther, neither or both?
 ((RW)) None of the above. I am a Libertarian.

He replied, ""My chances of winning are not all in my hands. I shall do my best, but it comes down to what others will do. What will you do?""
 When asked about America's shrinking middle class he said, ""The economic policies of the US government are the cause our troubles. When I am President, the only economic policy I shall pursue is to be frugal with the funds of the United States.""

A report released by Allan Gyngell of the Lowy Institute on Monday, revealed many Australians view US foreign policy to be as dangerous as Islamic fundamentalism. It also found that 58 percent of the population had a positive view of the United States.  
"," The Lowy Institute, established in 2003 with a $30 million endowment from Australian philanthropist Frank Lowy, claims it is ""an independent, non-partisan think tank.""
 The report, entitled ""Australians speak 2005: public opinion and foreign policy"", showed that global warming and nuclear proliferation were greater foreign policy concerns than terrorism and illegal immigration. 70 per cent of Australians were worried about global warming, the report stated, while only 63 per cent were worried about international terrorism. The report also noted most Australians believed improving the global environment should be Australia's number one foreign policy goal.
 Mark Wakeham of Greenpeace said, ""Clearly Australians understand the warnings from scientists about greenhouse pollution far better than our governments do. Once again, the community is leading and governments will be pulled into line.""
 He continued by saying, ""Scientists tell us that, to avoid dangerous warming of more than two degrees, we have to cut our greenhouse pollution by at least 60 per cent by 2050. This means moving rapidly and decisively away from dirty coal to clean, renewable sources of energy like solar, wind and energy efficiency.""
 The Lowy Institute surveyed 1000 randomly selected people to interview for the report.

"," Two Australian researchers at the Australian National University estimate that a global pandemic of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu could kill between 1.4 and 140 million humans and cause a global recession. They will formally present their research to the Lowy Institute in Sydney today.
 Professor Warwick McKibbin, a well respected economic modeller, member of the board of the Reserve Bank of Australia and health expert and Dr Alexandra Sidorenko modelled the effect of a bird flu pandemic on human health and the global economy. Their study looks at four possible scenarios - mild, moderate, severe and extreme.
 Under the mild scenario, they predict that 1.4 million people worldwide and 2,100 Australians would die. The extreme scenario predicts 140 million worldwide deaths with 214,000 Australians among them. 30 percent of the Australian population would be expected to become infected should a pandemic occur.
 In the extreme case, the global ecomomy would suffer losses of US$4.4 trillion or 12.6 percent.
 Prof. McKibbin says that his economic estimates do not only include the cost of death but also for lost productivity. In an interview with ABC, Professor McKibbin said ""Firstly, there's a reduction in the labour force. Now, interestingly it's not just that people die which is causing economic loss, but actually there is a substantial amount of illness in any influenza pandemic. ""
 ""And so we try and capture both the death and the impact of that on the economy as well as illness during the pandemic, and including the fact that different economies have different labour market structures and that it's not just workers that get sick but also children, and we try to model the fact that carers will be taking time off work. "" said Prof. McKibbin.
 Pandemics have broken out every 10 to 40 years since the 19th century. The last pandemic was in 1968 caused by the Hong Kong flu. 
 ""It is 37 years since the last pandemic and many argue that another pandemic is overdue,"" warns the report. The report advises investment in Asia, where health systems are less developed.

"," Over the past week, diplomatic actions have averted — or, at least delayed — military strikes on Syria by the United States. Wikinews sought input from a range of international experts on the situation; and, the tensions caused by Russia's support for the al-Assad regime despite its apparent use of chemical weapons.
 File:Ghouta chemical attack map.svg
 Tensions in the country increased dramatically, late August when it was reported between 100 and 1,300 people were killed in an alleged chemical attack. Many of those killed appeared to be children, with some of the pictures and video coming out of the country showing — according to witnesses — those who died from apparent suffocation; some foaming at the mouth, others having convulsions.
 Amongst Syria's few remaining allies, Iran, China, and Russia continue to oppose calls for military intervention. In an effort to provide a better-understanding of the reasoning behind their ongoing support, the following people were posed a range of questions.
 Iran, China, and Russia have remained as allies to the al-Assad government despite the alleged use of chemical weapons in Ghouta on August 21, 2013. Wikinews queried the listed subject-matter experts regarding the diplomatic relations between these nations, and the reasoning behind such.
 ((Wikinews))  There are suggestions China wants to maintain its financial ties with Syria as its third largest importer in 2010. Would you agree with this?
 ((WN))  Do you think China is talking from experience when it says that foreign countries shouldn't get involved with Syria's internal affairs? ((WN))  China abstained from a UN Security Council resolution on Libya — do you think they are trying to reprise what happened in Libya in terms of regime change?
 ((WN))  Do you think a political solution is the only realistic means to resolve the Syrian issue?
 ((Wikinews))  For many years, Syria has been considered Iran's ""closest ally"". What vested interest does the Iranian government have in keeping Bashar al-Assad in power? 
 ((Wikinews))  Do you think Iranian support for the Syrian government is a way of standing up against UN sanctions imposed on them, and opposing American imperialism?
 ((Wikinews))  The UN has ""overwhelmingly"" confirmed use of chemical weapons in Syria. Do you think both sides have used chemical weapons?
 ((Wikinews))  Would you agree that part of Iran's vested interest in Syria remaining under al-Assad is bound to two factors: religion and strategy?
 ((Wikinews))   Iran is home to the world's most populous Shiite Muslim nation. The Syrian rebels are Sunni. Could this be a Sunni vs. Shiite alignment in the Middle East? 
 ((Wikinews))  Russia is one of Syria's biggest arms suppliers. Do you think this means Russia's interest lies in economic benefit, as opposed to the humanitarian crisis?
 ((WN))  Do you believe Russia distrusts US intentions in the region — in the sense of countering the West on regime change?
 ((WN))  The Russian Government accepts that chemical weapons have been used in Syria. How does it come to claim that the rebels are behind the attacks even though it is widely accepted that the al-Assad government has stocks of weapons?
 ((WN))  Would you agree that Russia's vested interest in Syria remaining under al-Assad is bound to two factors: economics and ideology?
